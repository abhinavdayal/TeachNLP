There is so much out there to explore, from polar bears in the arctic to lemurs in the jungle!

the lemurs liked to swing.They jumped around and laughed and that's when they began to sing:We like to go exploring places that we've never been.Take one swing, and then another, that's how we begin.I

getting rather hot. I headed to the forest where the trees were made of gum,And if I come that way again, I’ll chew up every one.I hiked up to the mountains where the bobcat had her band. The goats

On the Great Hill, Yolks climb all day and all night. Follow one Yolk as he gets passed by others who happen to be faster at climbing. When he finally meets a Yolk who climbs even slower, he finds that there is one thing he has forgotten. Do you think he'll make it to the top? The allegory of The Great Hill teaches perseverance and perspective. The Great Hillby Daniel ErricoBefore time was time, there was a Great Hill. And on the Great Hill there lived the Yolks.The Yolks spent their entire lives climbing the Great Hill, trying to reach the top.Some Yolks climbed fast.Some Yolks climbed slowly.One Yolk in particular was a very slow climber. He was different than the rest of the Yolks.When he climbed, all the other Yolks passed him. It was hard for him to watch them pass by.He felt like the worst climber in the world.Some Yolks made fun of him as they passed.Others didn’t.Some Yolks wanted to help him climb but he didn’t let them.It was hard for him to climb. It was even harder when it rained because the ground got slippery. Sometimes it seemed like it was only raining on him. But it wasn’t.There were times when he felt like he wasn’t moving at all. But he was.Then one day he met another Yolk who climbed even slower than he did.He helped the slower Yolk climb.“Thank You,” said the slower Yolk.“You’re Welcome,” said the slow Yolk, “I can’t be of much help to anyone else since I climb so slowly.”“Slowly?” asked the slower Yolk.“Well yes. I watch other Yolks pass me all the time.” “I do not know if you are slow or fast, but I do know that you helped me, and that you are still climbing.”The slow Yolk said goodbye to the slower Yolk, and kept climbing. “Still climbing,” he thought to himself. “That is true.” And he smiled.So the Yolk kept climbing. He climbed when it was nice out, he climbed when it rained, and he even climbed when it snowed.As he kept climbing he got better and better. Sometimes he would pass other Yolks and sometimes they would pass him. He had stopped paying attention. He also noticed that some Yolks were no longer climbing. When a yolk stops climbing it stays where it is. Some Yolks stop climbing because they are happy with how far they have gone. Others stop climbing because they don’t want to climb anymore. The Yolks that had stopped climbing did not like to be passed, and they made it harder to get by. But the Yolk kept climbing, right over them!There were still times when the Yolk thought he was climbing an impossible hill, but he kept climbing. Always, always, climbing.Do you think he made the top?by Daniel ErricoBefore time was time, there was a Great Hill. And on the Great Hill there lived the Yolks.The Yolks spent their entire lives climbing the Great Hill, trying to reach the top.Some Yolks climbed fast.Some Yolks climbed slowly.One Yolk in particular was a very slow climber.

He climbed when it was nice out, he climbed when it rained, and he even climbed when it snowed.As he kept climbing he got better and better. Sometimes he would pass other Yolks and sometimes they would pass him. He had stopped paying attention. He also noticed that some Yolks were no longer climbing. When a yolk stops climbing it stays where it is. Some Yolks stop climbing because they are happy with how far they have gone. Others stop climbing because they don’t want to climb anymore. The Yolks that had stopped climbing did not like to be passed, and they made it harder to get by. But the Yolk kept climbing, right over them!There were still times when the Yolk thought he was climbing an impossible hill, but he kept climbing. Always, always, climbing.Do you think he made the top?He felt like the worst climber in the world.Some Yolks made fun of him as they passed.Others didn’t.Some Yolks wanted to help him climb but he didn’t let them.It was hard for him to climb. It was even harder when it rained because the ground got slippery. Sometimes it seemed like it was only raining on him. But it wasn’t.There were times when he felt like he wasn’t moving at all. But he was.Then one day he met another Yolk who climbed even slower than he did.He helped the slower Yolk climb.“Thank You,” said the slower Yolk.“You’re Welcome,” said the slow Yolk, “I can’t be of much help to anyone else since I climb so slowly.”“Slowly?” asked the slower Yolk.“Well yes.

"I want a monkey who scratches his head! He'd swing from the lights and he'd jump on the bed!" Everyone has wanted a pet at one point or another, but what happens when regular pets won't do? Wally dreams about rambunctious monkeys, noisy otters, and playful giraffes, but will he ever find the perfect pet?by Daniel ErricoWally was sure that he wanted a pet.He talked to his Dad about which pet to get.“I want a Monkey who scratches his head!He’d swing in the house and he’d jump on the bed.”“Well,” said his Dad in a kind sort of way, “Did you know that monkeys eat bugs everyday?”“Oh No,” Wally said, “We have none to eat.”Mom likes to squash all the bugs with her feet.”“Then I want a Hippo!” he screamed to his Dad.“He’d eat all our trash, and Mom would be glad!”“Hippos need water, it helps them stay cool.I guess we can build him a giant sized pool.”“No,” Wally said, “he’d be too big to dry,We’d need a mountain of towels to try.”“I want an Otter who triple back flips,I’d practice swimming when we go for dips.”“Did you know most otters can whistle and chirp?They growl and snort, and perhaps even burp?”“Oh,” Wally said with a sad looking frown,“We’d have to tell him to keep the noise down.”“Let’s get a Giraffe!” Wally said with a smile.“I’d slide from his neck to a giant clothes pile!”“Giraffes hold the record for tallest of all.”“The jump from their head is a twenty foot fall!”“Gosh,” Wally said as he looked at the ceiling,He’d bump his head even if he were kneeling.”“Well how ‘bout a bunny?” he said to his Dad,“A fluffy and floppy one can’t be that bad.”“Bunnies like eating and chew all your stuff. Raising a bunny can really be tough.”“Wow,” Wally answered, “Is that really true?Picking a pet is not easy to do.”“I want a fish!” Wally said, “Let’s get one!”“I think a Goldfish could be lots of fun.”“Hmm,” said his Dad, with a look of delight.“Good idea Wally; I think that you’re right!”“They’re really good swimmers and make funny faces.            And if we get two, we could watch them have races!”“Okay,” said his Dad, “That’s just what we’ll do.One goldfish for me, one goldfish for you!”Wally was sure that he wanted a pet.He talked to his Dad about which pet to get.“I want a Monkey who scratches his head!He’d swing in the house and he’d jump on the bed.”“Well,” said his Dad in a kind sort of way, “Did you know that monkeys eat bugs everyday?”“Oh No,” Wally said, “We have none to eat.”Mom likes to squash all the bugs with her feet.”“Then I want a Hippo!” he screamed to his Dad.“He’d eat all our trash, and Mom would be glad!”“Hippos need water, it helps them stay cool.I guess we can build him a giant sized pool.”“No,” Wally said, “he’d be too big to dry,We’d need a mountain of towels to try.”“I want an Otter who triple back flips,I’d practice swimming when we go for dips.”“Did you know most otters can whistle and chirp?They growl and snort, and perhaps even burp?”“Oh,” Wally said with a sad looking frown,“We’d have to tell him to keep the noise down.”“Let’s get a Giraffe!” Wally said with a smile.“I’d slide from his neck to a giant clothes pile!”“Giraffes hold the record for tallest of all.”“The jump from their head is a twenty foot fall!”“Gosh,” Wally said as he looked at the ceiling,He’d bump his head even if he were kneeling.”“Well how ‘bout a bunny?” he said to his Dad,“A fluffy and floppy one can’t be that bad.”“Bunnies like eating and chew all your stuff. Raising a bunny can really be tough.”“Wow,” Wally answered, “Is that really true?Picking a pet is not easy to do.”“I want a fish!” Wally said, “Let’s get one!”“I think a Goldfish could be lots of fun.”“Hmm,” said his Dad, with a look of delight.“Good idea Wally;

We don't know exactly where Om Nom Nom came from ... or what he is, but we do know a few things. The first is that he keeps popping up, and the second is that he will eat anything! Om Nom Nom is a whimsical and silly rhyming tale which spotlights the monorhyme (when all the lines rhyme with each other). Copyright © 2007-2021, Freechildrenstories.com, Daniel Errico, Soaring Ship, LLC.

Warren was just a regular wolf pup... until he discovered that the full moon brings on a transformation unlike any other. Instead of a wild wolf, Warren becomes a polite young boy. For Warren, you see, is the dreaded Wereboy!WEREBOYby Daniel ErricoThe wolves in the woods, grow as wild as trees.They do not say Thank You. They do not say Please. They roll in the dirt and they chomp and they growl.At nighttime they look at the moon and they howl.But Warren was different, the youngest wolf pup.He would not go howl. He would not look up. Instead he ran back to his cave to go hide. And you would not believe what would happen inside.The brightest full moon would cause Warren to change.From a furry young wolf, to a creature most strange. His hair would grow short, and run right to his head.His paws would spread out, and form fingers instead.His snout would shrink down to a small little nub.While his ears became small, like a one-day-old cub.   His teeth would unsharpen, like pieces of corn.And always, somehow, there were clothes to be worn.He’d stand on two legs, and start walking around.And on his behind, not a tail to be found!His parents were shocked when they saw him transform.It certainly, wolfenly, wasn’t the norm.Warren became a polite, quiet, joy.For Warren, you see, was a dreaded… Wereboy!He’d only eat sandwiches, without the crust.He’d didn’t talk back. He preferred earning trust. They scratched at their heads when he cleaned up the cave.It wasn’t how wolves had been taught to behave.His bedtime, he found, was just one tad too late.So he marched off the sleep, without any debate. Instead of the floor, he would sleep on a bed. Leaves for a blanket and straw for his head. By morning he’d be a young wolf pup again.They all kept the secret together. But then…A pack celebration to honor Sinclair,The eldest of wolves, with the whitest of hair. When it came time to howl they all looked around.But the family of Warren was not to be found.They came to the cave, and asked why they had hid.And that’s when they saw him. A… well… a kid.“A Wereboy!” they shouted, “What do we do??”“Don’t get too close or then you’ll catch it too!”Warren sat patiently, reading his books,But somehow, that made them give wolfier looks. His parents objected, “There’s nothing to fear,Everyone changes. Each one of us here.”“Warren’s the wolf that you all knew before,It’s just that he happens to be that and more!”Sinclair stepped ahead, with his scraggily knees.“Excuse me,” he creaked with a cough and a weeze.“I have just the test, and we’ll know the truth soon.All wolves, be they true, howl up at the moon.”So the pack gathered round and they brought him outside.And Warren did something he hadn’t yet tried. He lifted his head and he puffed out his chest,Looked straight at the moon and he gave it his best.And from inside his heart, where it lay all along, Came not a howl, but a beautiful song. Soon one by one, all the wolves sat to listen.Until morning dew on the grass came to glisten. His parents, Sinclair, and the wolves from his pack,Watched the sun change him from Wereboy to back.And they saw him, this time, as they had not before.A wolf, and a boy, and forever, much more. WEREBOYby Daniel ErricoThe wolves in the woods, grow as wild as trees.They do not say Thank You.

He preferred earning trust. They scratched at their heads when he cleaned up the cave.It wasn’t how wolves had been taught to behave.His bedtime, he found, was just one tad too late.So he marched off the sleep, without any debate. Instead of the floor, he would sleep on a bed. Leaves for a blanket and straw for his head. By morning he’d be a young wolf pup again.They all kept the secret together. But then…A pack celebration to honor Sinclair,The eldest of wolves, with the whitest of hair. When it came time to howl they all looked around.But the family of Warren was not to be found.They came to the cave, and asked why they had hid.And that’s when they saw him. A… well… a kid.“A Wereboy!” they shouted, “What do we do??”“Don’t get too close or then you’ll catch it too!”Warren sat patiently, reading his books,But somehow, that made them give wolfier looks. His parents objected, “There’s nothing to fear,Everyone changes. Each one of us here.”“Warren’s the wolf that you all knew before,It’s just that he happens to be that and more!”Sinclair stepped ahead, with his scraggily knees.“Excuse me,” he creaked with a cough and a weeze.“I have just the test, and we’ll know the truth soon.All wolves, be they true, howl up at the moon.”So the pack gathered round and they brought him outside.And Warren did something he hadn’t yet tried. He lifted his head and he puffed out his chest,Looked straight at the moon and he gave it his best.And from inside his heart, where it lay all along, Came not a howl, but a beautiful song. Soon one by one, all the wolves sat to listen.Until morning dew on the grass came to glisten. His parents, Sinclair, and the wolves from his pack,Watched the sun change him from Wereboy to back.And they saw him, this time, as they had not before.A wolf, and a boy, and forever, much more. They roll in the dirt and they chomp and they growl.At nighttime they look at the moon and they howl.But Warren was different, the youngest wolf pup.He would not go howl.

He preferred earning trust. They scratched at their heads when he cleaned up the cave.It wasn’t how wolves had been taught to behave.His bedtime, he found, was just one tad too late.So he marched off the sleep, without any debate. Instead of the floor, he would sleep on a bed. Leaves for a blanket and straw for his head. By morning he’d be a young wolf pup again.They all kept the secret together. But then…A pack celebration to honor Sinclair,The eldest of wolves, with the whitest of hair. When it came time to howl they all looked around.But the family of Warren was not to be found.They came to the cave, and asked why they had hid.And that’s when they saw him.

Each one of us here.”“Warren’s the wolf that you all knew before,It’s just that he happens to be that and more!”Sinclair stepped ahead, with his scraggily knees.“Excuse me,” he creaked with a cough and a weeze.“I have just the test, and we’ll know the truth soon.All wolves, be they true, howl up at the moon.”So the pack gathered round and they brought him outside.And Warren did something he hadn’t yet tried. He lifted his head and he puffed out his chest,Looked straight at the moon and he gave it his best.And from inside his heart, where it lay all along, Came not a howl, but a beautiful song. Soon one by one, all the wolves sat to listen.Until morning dew on the grass came to glisten. His parents, Sinclair, and the wolves from his pack,Watched the sun change him from Wereboy to back.And they saw him, this time, as they had not before.A wolf, and a boy, and forever, much more. And on his behind, not a tail to be found!His parents were shocked when they saw him transform.It certainly, wolfenly, wasn’t the norm.Warren became a polite, quiet, joy.For Warren, you see, was a dreaded… Wereboy!He’d only eat sandwiches, without the crust.He’d didn’t talk back. He preferred earning trust. They scratched at their heads when he cleaned up the cave.It wasn’t how wolves had been taught to behave.His bedtime, he found, was just one tad too late.So he marched off the sleep, without any debate. Instead of the floor, he would sleep on a bed. Leaves for a blanket and straw for his head. By morning he’d be a young wolf pup again.They all kept the secret together.

Each one of us here.”“Warren’s the wolf that you all knew before,It’s just that he happens to be that and more!”Sinclair stepped ahead, with his scraggily knees.“Excuse me,” he creaked with a cough and a weeze.“I have just the test, and we’ll know the truth soon.All wolves, be they true, howl up at the moon.”So the pack gathered round and they brought him outside.And Warren did something he hadn’t yet tried. He lifted his head and he puffed out his chest,Looked straight at the moon and he gave it his best.And from inside his heart, where it lay all along, Came not a howl, but a beautiful song. Soon one by one, all the wolves sat to listen.Until morning dew on the grass came to glisten. His parents, Sinclair, and the wolves from his pack,Watched the sun change him from Wereboy to back.And they saw him, this time, as they had not before.A wolf, and a boy, and forever, much more. Instead of the floor, he would sleep on a bed. Leaves for a blanket and straw for his head. By morning he’d be a young wolf pup again.They all kept the secret together.

hadn’t yet tried. He lifted his head and he puffed out his chest,Looked straight at the moon and he gave it his best.And from inside his heart, where it lay all along, Came not a howl, but a beautiful song. Soon one by one, all the wolves sat to listen.Until morning dew on the grass came to glisten. His parents, Sinclair, and the wolves from his pack,Watched the sun change him from Wereboy to back.And they saw him, this time, as they had not before.A wolf, and a boy, and forever, much more. “Warren’s the wolf that you all knew before,It’s just that he happens to be that and more!”Sinclair
