Long ago, there was a rock floating through space, searching for where she belonged. She would visit many planets and travel to the farthest reaches of the universe, but would she find what she was looking for? The Stellar One is a tale of self-esteem and self-discovery.if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0')};  by Daniel ErricoWhen the universe was young the sky was filled with planets, and stars, and stardust, and many many rocks. One of these rocks was a bit more special than the rest.  She was unlike any that came before her. She was a kind and happy rock, who always floated near a big blue planet. Sometimes when the light hit her surface, she would glow a brilliant green.  At times like those, she almost didn't look like a rock at all. As the sky moved from day to day, and week to week, the rock would see planets far off in the distance. She would wonder what it would be like to go to them. Week after week and month after month she would wonder. Until one day she decided to go find out. The rock had never gone anywhere before and wasn't sure how to go about it. She started to rock back and forth.Then she started to spin. Soon enough, she was flying through the sky. As she left, clouds swirled on the big blue planet. For it was sad to see her go, and when planets cry there is a rain storm. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-box-4-0')};At first the rock was not good at moving. She would spin too far to the right or too far to the left. Slowly she learned how to travel whichever direction she liked, and she enjoyed exploring space. She saw a planet filled with water, with not a speck of land.Then found a planet all dried up, with beaches made of sand.She swore she met a planet who looked suspiciously like her.And then she saw a planet that was, well… she wasn’t sure. One planet she discovered, had grown forests made of green.Another one was very shy, not fond of being seen.She flew right by a planet, that was frozen icy cold.And then she saw a planet that was made of jewels and gold!She had started to notice that each planet seemed brighter than the last. They were all so different and all so pretty. It became hard for her to decide where to go next. If each planet she visited was more beautiful than the one before it, then how could she decide which way to go next, and how could she decide where to stay. So she continued traveling, afraid to miss a single planet. Eventually she came upon the big blue planet that she had once circled, but she found that is was not the same. It was shining in a way that it never had before. It was more blue than it had ever been, and certainly more beautiful. This made her stop for a moment. “I do not know where I should go next” she said out loud. “Each direction is filled with wonderful planets. And I cannot stop, knowing that the next planet will be even more beautiful if I continue on. Even my big blue planet has grown more beautiful every day in my absence.”The big blue planet overheard this. “Can you not see why I am brighter?" it asked.if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0_1')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0_2')};.large-leaderboard-2-multi-635{border:none!important;display:block!important;float:none;line-height:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-height:250px;min-width:300px;padding:0;text-align:center!important}"You are the brightest planet I have ever seen," she said, "but I do not know why you glow brighter today than you did when I left you."“You have brightened me,” it said. “But I am just a rock” she replied. “You are no longer just a rock like the day you left me,” said the big blue planet. “You have grown bold and bright. Now you are a shooting star, and you are the reason that I shine.  And while you are worrying about which direction to go, all of the planets in space are hoping that you will come their way to brighten them.”And so the shooting star, who was no longer just a rock, finally understood. It did not matter where she went, the light was her own. So the rock sat there for a moment, by the bright blue planet and wondered.  "Should I keep traveling, or should I fly around the big blue planet and grow brighter with it each day.”She thought, until she knew exactly what to do. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-leader-1-0')};When the universe was young the sky was filled with planets, and stars, and stardust, and many many rocks. One of these rocks was a bit more special than the rest.  She was unlike any that came before her. She was a kind and happy rock, who always floated near a big blue planet. Sometimes when the light hit her surface, she would glow a brilliant green.  At times like those, she almost didn't look like a rock at all. As the sky moved from day to day, and week to week, the rock would see planets far off in the distance. She would wonder what it would be like to go to them.

She would spin too far to the right or too far to the left. Slowly she learned how to travel whichever direction she liked, and she enjoyed exploring space. She saw a planet filled with water, with not a speck of land.Then found a planet all dried up, with beaches made of sand.She swore she met a planet who looked suspiciously like her.And then she saw a planet that was, well… she wasn’t sure. One planet she discovered, had grown forests made of green.Another one was very shy, not fond of being seen.She flew right by a planet, that was frozen icy cold.And then she saw a planet that was made of jewels and gold!She had started to notice that each planet seemed brighter than the last. They were all so different and all so pretty. It became hard for her to decide where to go next. If each planet she visited was more beautiful than the one before it, then how could she decide which way to go next, and how could she decide where to stay. So she continued traveling, afraid to miss a single planet. Eventually she came upon the big blue planet that she had once circled, but she found that is was not the same. It was shining in a way that it never had before. It was more blue than it had ever been, and certainly more beautiful. This made her stop for a moment. “I do not know where I should go next” she said out loud. “Each direction is filled with wonderful planets. And I cannot stop, knowing that the next planet will be even more beautiful if I continue on. Even my big blue planet has grown more beautiful every day in my absence.”The big blue planet overheard this. “Can you not see why I am brighter?" it asked.if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0_1')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0_2')};.large-leaderboard-2-multi-635{border:none!important;display:block!important;float:none;line-height:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-height:250px;min-width:300px;padding:0;text-align:center!important}"You are the brightest planet I have ever seen," she said, "but I do not know why you glow brighter today than you did when I left you."“You have brightened me,” it said. “But I am just a rock” she replied. “You are no longer just a rock like the day you left me,” said the big blue planet. “You have grown bold and bright.

On the Great Hill, Yolks climb all day and all night. Follow one Yolk as he gets passed by others who happen to be faster at climbing. When he finally meets a Yolk who climbs even slower, he finds that there is one thing he has forgotten. Do you think he'll make it to the top?

He was different than the rest of the Yolks.When he climbed, all the other Yolks passed him. It was hard for him to watch them pass by.He felt like the worst climber in the world.Some Yolks made fun of him as they passed.Others didn’t.Some Yolks wanted to help him climb but he didn’t let them.if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-medrectangle-4-0')};It was hard for him to climb.

Before the school year started, I’d heard rumors about her, and within a week I realized that they were all true. For one thing, she did, in fact, wear the same outfit every day; the colors changed, but she always had on striped pants and a striped jacket. For another thing, she was mind-numbingly boring. The kind of boring that makes your eyes shut without your permission. The biggest problem, though, was the stories. She was obsessed with tales of former students who had become some kind of famous. The first couple of times weren’t bad, maybe even kind of interesting, but by the second week of school she had started repeating herself, just like her outfits. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-box-3-0')};By then, I knew all the stories by heart. The professional football player who was good at math. The politician who was a teacher’s pet. I knew every word. Instead of trying my hardest to listen, I spent most of class drawing in my notebook. Most classes, I drew imaginary places and then whipped up some creatures to fill them. They had horns where horns don’t go, fur where scales should be, and all the wings. They were odd, and they each had a story that I wanted to tell. But, on that day, I never even got to the first pair of wings. I had barely gotten started when the frog appeared and changed my life forever.It was a moment of exceptional boredom when I saw it. Its little green face was pressed up against the window nearest to me. My pencil stopped dead in its stubby tracks. I couldn’t stop looking at the frog and it couldn’t stop looking back. We were locked in a staring contest with unknown stakes. Maybe some frogs blinked, but with its eyes smushed against the glass, this one didn’t. Stagwood Forest was just beyond the schoolyard and it was riddled with frogs, but they always avoided people. I knew right away, in a way that I could think better than I could say, that this frog was different.I tried to listen back in to Miss Weaver, just in time to hear the end of her story about Martin Shandals, the now-famous comedian. Martin had transferred schools half way through the year, so I always felt to me like that one shouldn’t count. We were supposed to be learning long division, but something had reminded her of Martin. I knew exactly what bad joke she would end the story with, and much less about long division. “Whenever he acted up in class I’d say, ‘we’ve got a real comedian on our hands don’t we?’ And I was right!” she said with a giggle. I was sure that Miss Weaver would see the frog eventually, but I was wrong. Nobody did. When I looked again to see if it was still there, I noticed something shiny. It made me forget all about class, and Miss Weaver and Martin Shandals. There was no denying it: this frog had put on a tiny pair of glasses. I wanted to lecture it, to explain that frogs don’t wear glasses. It bothered me that it didn’t already know that. On top of that, it had been staring at me for at least five minutes. It seemed to be bordering on rude. Could a frog even be rude? I wasn’t sure. But, the bigger question was why it was so interested in me.I wasn't the type of kid who got attention. Teachers always wrote “needs to participate more” on my report cards (with a smiley face to make my parents feel better). I never got into trouble and barely ever stood out on purpose. A few years earlier, I accidentally peed my pants because my zipper had gotten stuck in the bathroom at the last moment. I tried to convince everyone that I had fallen into a puddle at recess. The custodian, Mr. Salazar, charged outside with a mop and brought me with him to point out the puddle. My guess is that we wasted a half-hour looking around at the dry gravel. Luckily, my mom dropped off some new clothes and nobody really noticed my wardrobe change (…or that it hadn’t rained in weeks). That’s how it was. Whether I did something spectacular or sneezed myself out of a chair, nobody cared, and almost nobody said my name. As far as school was concerned, all those things had happened to “some kid”. So, why would a frog with glasses jump up on a windowsill to stare at "some kid"? Teachers, on the other hand, were a different story. Once her lesson started back up, it didn’t take Miss Weaver long to realize that I wasn’t paying attention. She called me up to the blackboard to make an example out of me. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-medrectangle-3-0')};“Since you don’t feel the need to listen, why don’t you solve a problem on the board instead?” she said, sitting down at her desk. My stomach immediately did a flip. Then it did a flop. The problem would take a minute or two to solve, and being in front of the class always made me nervous. How could I be expected to do anything when there was a spectacled frog staring me down?I walked to the right of the equation on the board so that I could check on the frog with a glance. Despite the distraction, I did my best to focus. Halfway through, I saw that the frog had moved towards the front of the classroom. It stopped at the window by Miss Weaver’s desk. It took me a moment to figure out what it was doing. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was trying to lift the window!Finishing the problem became almost impossible. I made a mistake and then quickly erased it. The next time I looked over, the window was open. Why should that surprise me? Of course a frog with glasses would also be super strong. The window was only open an inch, but that was enough for it to slip through. I dropped the chalk, and some of my classmates laughed. Bending down to pick it up, I tried convincing myself that when I stood back up again the frog would be gone. “It’s not there. I just think it’s there.”When I straightened up, the frog was sitting on Miss Weaver’s left shoulder. This was a brave frog. Her head blocked the class from seeing it, and I realized that I was still the only one who could. Either the frog was real or my imagination had outdone itself. It wasn’t all that surprising that Miss Weaver didn’t feel it there, because the shoulder pads inside her jacket were large and fluffy. I had heard that she rested her head on them like pillows during her breaks. There was a frog sitting on Miss Weaver’s shoulder and nobody else knew it. And I was supposed to be doing math.Now that it was closer, I could see the frog better. It didn’t look like some new species of frog to me. It looked like every other frog I had seen (except for the glasses). I wondered if they made contacts small enough for a frog. But, it wasn’t the right time to worry about frog vision. That would be a job for a frog eye doctor, anyway.I had daydreams all the time when I was drawing, and sometimes I got lost in them. It was possible, I thought, that my imagination had just carried me away. I tried one last time to explain the frog away as part of an elaborate daydream. I concentrated hard, finished the problem, and put the chalk down. The frog couldn’t be real. I shook my head confidently. When I turned to Miss Weaver, I saw the frog look me square in the eyes and nod. A moment later, it disappeared into Miss Weaver’s hair. Miss Weaver had been my teacher for a few months, and was best known around Stagwood for having a stack of black hair that rose a foot above her head.

I made a mistake and then quickly erased it. The next time I looked over, the window was open. Why should that surprise me? Of course a frog with glasses would also be super strong. The window was only open an inch, but that was enough for it to slip through. I dropped the chalk, and some of my classmates laughed. Bending down to pick it up, I tried convincing myself that when I stood back up again the frog would be gone. “It’s not there. I just think it’s there.”When I straightened up, the frog was sitting on Miss Weaver’s left shoulder. This was a brave frog. Her head blocked the class from seeing it, and I realized that I was still the only one who could. Either the frog was real or my imagination had outdone itself. It wasn’t all that surprising that Miss Weaver didn’t feel it there, because the shoulder pads inside her jacket were large and fluffy. I had heard that she rested her head on them like pillows during her breaks. There was a frog sitting on Miss Weaver’s shoulder and nobody else knew it. And I was supposed to be doing math.Now that it was closer, I could see the frog better. It didn’t look like some new species of frog to me. It looked like every other frog I had seen (except for the glasses). I wondered if they made contacts small enough for a frog. But, it wasn’t the right time to worry about frog vision. That would be a job for a frog eye doctor, anyway.I had daydreams all the time when I was drawing, and sometimes I got lost in them. It was possible, I thought, that my imagination had just carried me away. I tried one last time to explain the frog away as part of an elaborate daydream. I concentrated hard, finished the problem, and put the chalk down. The frog couldn’t be real. I shook my head confidently. When I turned to Miss Weaver, I saw the frog look me square in the eyes and nod. A moment later, it disappeared into Miss Weaver’s hair. “Whenever he acted up in class I’d say, ‘we’ve got a real comedian on our hands don’t we?’ And I was right!” she said with a giggle. I was sure that Miss Weaver would see the frog eventually, but I was wrong. Nobody did. When I looked again to see if it was still there, I noticed something shiny. It made me forget all about class, and Miss Weaver and Martin Shandals. There was no denying it: this frog had put on a tiny pair of glasses. I wanted to lecture it, to explain that frogs don’t wear glasses. It bothered me that it didn’t already know that. On top of that, it had been staring at me for at least five minutes. It seemed to be bordering on rude. Could a frog even be rude? I wasn’t sure. But, the bigger question was why it was so interested in me.I wasn't the type of kid who got attention. Teachers always wrote “needs to participate more” on my report cards (with a smiley face to make my parents feel better). I never got into trouble and barely ever stood out on purpose. A few years earlier, I accidentally peed my pants because my zipper had gotten stuck in the bathroom at the last moment. I tried to convince everyone that I had fallen into a puddle at recess. The custodian, Mr. Salazar, charged outside with a mop and brought me with him to point out the puddle. My guess is that we wasted a half-hour looking around at the dry gravel. Luckily, my mom dropped off some new clothes and nobody really noticed my wardrobe change (…or that it hadn’t rained in weeks). That’s how it was. Whether I did something spectacular or sneezed myself out of a chair, nobody cared, and almost nobody said my name. As far as school was concerned, all those things had happened to “some kid”. So, why would a frog with glasses jump up on a windowsill to stare at "some kid"? Teachers, on the other hand, were a different story. Once her lesson started back up, it didn’t take Miss Weaver long to realize that I wasn’t paying attention. She called me up to the blackboard to make an example out of me. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-medrectangle-3-0')};“Since you don’t feel the need to listen, why don’t you solve a problem on the board instead?” she said, sitting down at her desk. My stomach immediately did a flip. Then it did a flop. The problem would take a minute or two to solve, and being in front of the class always made me nervous. How could I be expected to do anything when there was a spectacled frog staring me down?I walked to the right of the equation on the board so that I could check on the frog with a glance.

Either the frog was real or my imagination had outdone itself. It wasn’t all that surprising that Miss Weaver didn’t feel it there, because the shoulder pads inside her jacket were large and fluffy. I had heard that she rested her head on them like pillows during her breaks. There was a frog sitting on Miss Weaver’s shoulder and nobody else knew it. And I was supposed to be doing math.Now that it was closer, I could see the frog better. It didn’t look like some new species of frog to me. It looked like every other frog I had seen (except for the glasses). I wondered if they made contacts small enough for a frog. But, it wasn’t the right time to worry about frog vision. That would be a job for a frog eye doctor, anyway.I had daydreams all the time when I was drawing, and sometimes I got lost in them. It was possible, I thought, that my imagination had just carried me away. I tried one last time to explain the frog away as part of an elaborate daydream. I concentrated hard, finished the problem, and put the chalk down. The frog couldn’t be real. I shook my head confidently. When I turned to Miss Weaver, I saw the frog look me square in the eyes and nod. A moment later, it disappeared into Miss Weaver’s hair. Finishing the problem became almost impossible. I made a mistake and then quickly erased it. The next time I looked over, the window was open. Why should that surprise me? Of course a frog with glasses would also be super strong. The window was only open an inch, but that was enough for it to slip through. I dropped the chalk, and some of my classmates laughed. Bending down to pick it up, I tried convincing myself that when I stood back up again the frog would be gone. “It’s not there.

A moment later, it disappeared into Miss Weaver’s hair. Soy had the frog in his hands within seconds. He was always good with outdoorsy stuff like that. His mom was usually busy with his siblings, so Soy was left to play outside a lot. By third grade, he had caught a pet turtle, salamander, and flying squirrel. Unfortunately, his older brothers Rick and Hank stole the squirrel and kept it in their room. Once a week they played a game where Rick threw the squirrel from the second story window, and Hank caught it midair with a trash can as it glided down. Soy tried to get them to stop, but they never listened.  The frog didn’t put up much of a fight. I started to wonder if it actually wanted to be caught. “Do you believe me now?” I asked.Soy peaked inside his hands, and then lifted his head. "Well… this frog is wearing glasses. I’ll give you that.”Both of our minds were racing with questions.“Let’s bring it to my treehouse, so we can figure this out,” I said. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0')}; I had built most of the treehouse in my backyard myself. My mom and dad insisted on one of them being there when I used certain tools, but that was about it. Building things always made me feel good afterwards, and I had gotten pretty good at it. The treehouse had been done for a while, but there were still a few things I wanted to add to it before winter.   When we got there, I told Soy to use the elevator. It was really just a rope with a weighted pulley system, but I called it the elevator anyway. We used it when we needed to carry things that we couldn’t bring up on the ladder. I climbed up and then lowered it down for him. All those years of critter-handling had paid off, and he got it inside the treehouse without any problem. I shut the door and quadruple-locked it, so that the frog couldn’t run away (and also to give us some privacy).  “Okay, Soy,” I said, "let him loose." Soy lowered his hands and opened them, letting the frog hop to the floor of the treehouse. I had a small drafting table, drawings, and bits of wood all over, which provided plenty of places for the frog to hide. Luckily for us, it didn’t move at all. Instead it looked up at me, and in a loud voice said, “What do you mean, him?”Soy fell backwards from a crouch onto his rear. The frog was looking right at me, waiting for an answer, but all I could do was shake my head."It’s rude to assume I’m a ‘he’, don’t you think? I happen to be female,” said the frog proudly. Soy was now holding his head with both hands. “It can talk!!” he said in disbelief."Well, now calling me an ‘it’, after I just told you I was a girl, is just plain inconsiderate, Soy,” she said.  I knelt down closer, looking for anything that might make sense of it all. Maybe the frog was a robot? But nothing about the way it moved was robotic. And would a “Made in China” sticker really make me feel better? It… she… had just called my best friend by his first name! Soy was so flabbergasted that he was gnawing on his backpack strap, so I doubted that they had met before.  “I’m sorry,” I said to the frog, kneeling down, “we didn’t mean anything by it. Truly.”The frog hopped even closer and said, “You’ve always been kind,” then whispered, “it’s a powerful thing. Remember that.”“I will,” I said, amazed that I had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds. “But, um, if you don’t mind me asking, how is it that you can talk?” I said. By that point Soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth. The frog crooked her head at me slightly. “Do you think that humans are the only animals that can talk?” she asked. I was startled. Was it possible that animals could talk, and somehow no one in the world knew about it? Was everything that I thought about animals wrong? I took a seat on the floor, too. Soy spit out his strap. "That’s not cool,” he said. “I tell my pet iguana all of my secrets. If he can talk, I need to know who he’s been talking to.”The frog gave out a little laugh, then she said, “Oh, I’m just kidding. Animals can’t talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly.” I was embarrassed, but mostly relieved. “What about some kind of iguana sign language?” asked Soy, still nervous. Ignoring Soy's question, I asked the frog, “How is it that you can? Talk, I mean." “For starters, I’m not a frog,” she explained. “The only reason that I—” Without any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. “What are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?” asked my mom sternly.I searched my brain for an answer that didn’t have the word frog in it. “Soy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away." I replied.“He’s a clever one” the frog whispered to Soy. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')}; I gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that a frog had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a female voice, she would break down that door, quadruple-lock or no. I added another lock every time she broke down the door. A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke. I added the fourth lock that night, but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for “mom strength”. For the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”.  “Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you,” my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door, “and he looks pretty official. He’s even wearing a fancy suit with a shiny yellow bowtie. Don’t worry though, he assured me you’ve done nothing wrong.” “Yellow!” screeched the frog.“What?” asked my mom.“Oh, I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she said.“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I said nervously. “Oh. I didn’t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,” she said, getting even closer to the door, “because that’s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.”  I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house. The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house. I was amazed at how high she could jump. It was immediately clear that she could have left any time that she had wanted. “Whatever you do, don’t mention me,” the frog whispered frantically. “I’ll find you later.” And with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below. The frog didn’t put up much of a fight. I started to wonder if it actually wanted to be caught. “Do you believe me now?” I asked.Soy peaked inside his hands, and then lifted his head. "Well… this frog is wearing glasses.

If he can talk, I need to know who he’s been talking to.”The frog gave out a little laugh, then she said, “Oh, I’m just kidding. Animals can’t talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly.” I was embarrassed, but mostly relieved. “What about some kind of iguana sign language?” asked Soy, still nervous. Ignoring Soy's question, I asked the frog, “How is it that you can? Talk, I mean." “For starters, I’m not a frog,” she explained. “The only reason that I—” Without any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. “What are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?” asked my mom sternly.I searched my brain for an answer that didn’t have the word frog in it. “Soy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away." I replied.“He’s a clever one” the frog whispered to Soy. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')}; I gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that a frog had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a female voice, she would break down that door, quadruple-lock or no. I added another lock every time she broke down the door. A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke. I added the fourth lock that night, but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for “mom strength”. For the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”.  “Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you,” my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door, “and he looks pretty official. He’s even wearing a fancy suit with a shiny yellow bowtie. Don’t worry though, he assured me you’ve done nothing wrong.” “Yellow!” screeched the frog.“What?” asked my mom.“Oh, I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she said.“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I said nervously. “Oh. I didn’t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,” she said, getting even closer to the door, “because that’s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.”  I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house. The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house. I was amazed at how high she could jump. It was immediately clear that she could have left any time that she had wanted. “Whatever you do, don’t mention me,” the frog whispered frantically. “I’ll find you later.” And with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below.Both of our minds were racing with questions.“Let’s bring it to my treehouse, so we can figure this out,” I said. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0')}; I had built most of the treehouse in my backyard myself. My mom and dad insisted on one of them being there when I used certain tools, but that was about it. Building things always made me feel good afterwards, and I had gotten pretty good at it. The treehouse had been done for a while, but there were still a few things I wanted to add to it before winter.   When we got there, I told Soy to use the elevator. It was really just a rope with a weighted pulley system, but I called it the elevator anyway. We used it when we needed to carry things that we couldn’t bring up on the ladder. I climbed up and then lowered it down for him. All those years of critter-handling had paid off, and he got it inside the treehouse without any problem. I shut the door and quadruple-locked it, so that the frog couldn’t run away (and also to give us some privacy).  “Okay, Soy,” I said, "let him loose." Soy lowered his hands and opened them, letting the frog hop to the floor of the treehouse. I had a small drafting table, drawings, and bits of wood all over, which provided plenty of places for the frog to hide. Luckily for us, it didn’t move at all. Instead it looked up at me, and in a loud voice said, “What do you mean, him?”Soy fell backwards from a crouch onto his rear. The frog was looking right at me, waiting for an answer, but all I could do was shake my head."It’s rude to assume I’m a ‘he’, don’t you think? I happen to be female,” said the frog proudly. Soy was now holding his head with both hands. “It can talk!!” he said in disbelief."Well, now calling me an ‘it’, after I just told you I was a girl, is just plain inconsiderate, Soy,” she said.  I knelt down closer, looking for anything that might make sense of it all. Maybe the frog was a robot? But nothing about the way it moved was robotic. And would a “Made in China” sticker really make me feel better? It… she… had just called my best friend by his first name! Soy was so flabbergasted that he was gnawing on his backpack strap, so I doubted that they had met before.  “I’m sorry,” I said to the frog, kneeling down, “we didn’t mean anything by it. Truly.”The frog hopped even closer and said, “You’ve always been kind,” then whispered, “it’s a powerful thing. Remember that.”“I will,” I said, amazed that I had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds. “But, um, if you don’t mind me asking, how is it that you can talk?” I said. By that point Soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth. The frog crooked her head at me slightly. “Do you think that humans are the only animals that can talk?” she asked. I was startled.

Just hurry up and come down, please.”  I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house. The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house. I was amazed at how high she could jump. It was immediately clear that she could have left any time that she had wanted. “Whatever you do, don’t mention me,” the frog whispered frantically. “I’ll find you later.” And with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below. “Okay, Soy,” I said, "let him loose." Soy lowered his hands and opened them, letting the frog hop to the floor of the treehouse. I had a small drafting table, drawings, and bits of wood all over, which provided plenty of places for the frog to hide. Luckily for us, it didn’t move at all. Instead it looked up at me, and in a loud voice said, “What do you mean, him?”Soy fell backwards from a crouch onto his rear. The frog was looking right at me, waiting for an answer, but all I could do was shake my head."It’s rude to assume I’m a ‘he’, don’t you think? I happen to be female,” said the frog proudly. Soy was now holding his head with both hands. “It can talk!!” he said in disbelief."Well, now calling me an ‘it’, after I just told you I was a girl, is just plain inconsiderate, Soy,” she said.  I knelt down closer, looking for anything that might make sense of it all. Maybe the frog was a robot? But nothing about the way it moved was robotic. And would a “Made in China” sticker really make me feel better? It… she… had just called my best friend by his first name! Soy was so flabbergasted that he was gnawing on his backpack strap, so I doubted that they had met before.  “I’m sorry,” I said to the frog, kneeling down, “we didn’t mean anything by it. Truly.”The frog hopped even closer and said, “You’ve always been kind,” then whispered, “it’s a powerful thing. Remember that.”“I will,” I said, amazed that I had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds. “But, um, if you don’t mind me asking, how is it that you can talk?” I said. By that point Soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth. The frog crooked her head at me slightly. “Do you think that humans are the only animals that can talk?” she asked. I was startled. Was it possible that animals could talk, and somehow no one in the world knew about it? Was everything that I thought about animals wrong? I took a seat on the floor, too. Soy spit out his strap. "That’s not cool,” he said. “I tell my pet iguana all of my secrets. If he can talk, I need to know who he’s been talking to.”The frog gave out a little laugh, then she said, “Oh, I’m just kidding. Animals can’t talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly.” I was embarrassed, but mostly relieved. “What about some kind of iguana sign language?” asked Soy, still nervous. Ignoring Soy's question, I asked the frog, “How is it that you can? Talk, I mean." “For starters, I’m not a frog,” she explained. “The only reason that I—” Without any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. “What are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?” asked my mom sternly.I searched my brain for an answer that didn’t have the word frog in it. “Soy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away." I replied.“He’s a clever one” the frog whispered to Soy. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')}; I gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that a frog had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a female voice, she would break down that door, quadruple-lock or no. I added another lock every time she broke down the door. A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke. I added the fourth lock that night, but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for “mom strength”. For the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”.  “Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you,” my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door, “and he looks pretty official. He’s even wearing a fancy suit with a shiny yellow bowtie. Don’t worry though, he assured me you’ve done nothing wrong.” “Yellow!” screeched the frog.“What?” asked my mom.“Oh, I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she said.“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I said nervously. “Oh. I didn’t realize.

If my mom heard a female voice, she would break down that door, quadruple-lock or no. I added another lock every time she broke down the door. A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke. I added the fourth lock that night, but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for “mom strength”. For the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”.  “Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you,” my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door, “and he looks pretty official. He’s even wearing a fancy suit with a shiny yellow bowtie. Don’t worry though, he assured me you’ve done nothing wrong.” “Yellow!” screeched the frog.“What?” asked my mom.“Oh, I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she said.“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I said nervously. “Oh. I didn’t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,” she said, getting even closer to the door, “because that’s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.”  I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house. The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house. I was amazed at how high she could jump. It was immediately clear that she could have left any time that she had wanted. “Whatever you do, don’t mention me,” the frog whispered frantically. “I’ll find you later.” And with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below. “I’m sorry,” I said to the frog, kneeling down, “we didn’t mean anything by it. Truly.”The frog hopped even closer and said, “You’ve always been kind,” then whispered, “it’s a powerful thing. Remember that.”“I will,” I said, amazed that I had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds. “But, um, if you don’t mind me asking, how is it that you can talk?” I said. By that point Soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth. The frog crooked her head at me slightly. “Do you think that humans are the only animals that can talk?” she asked. I was startled. Was it possible that animals could talk, and somehow no one in the world knew about it? Was everything that I thought about animals wrong? I took a seat on the floor, too. Soy spit out his strap. "That’s not cool,” he said. “I tell my pet iguana all of my secrets. If he can talk, I need to know who he’s been talking to.”The frog gave out a little laugh, then she said, “Oh, I’m just kidding. Animals can’t talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly.” I was embarrassed, but mostly relieved. “What about some kind of iguana sign language?” asked Soy, still nervous. Ignoring Soy's question, I asked the frog, “How is it that you can? Talk, I mean." “For starters, I’m not a frog,” she explained. “The only reason that I—” Without any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. “What are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?” asked my mom sternly.I searched my brain for an answer that didn’t have the word frog in it. “Soy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away."

Talk, I mean." “For starters, I’m not a frog,” she explained. “The only reason that I—” Without any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. “What are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?” asked my mom sternly.I searched my brain for an answer that didn’t have the word frog in it. “Soy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away." I replied.“He’s a clever one” the frog whispered to Soy. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')}; I gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that a frog had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a female voice, she would break down that door, quadruple-lock or no. I added another lock every time she broke down the door. A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke. I added the fourth lock that night, but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for “mom strength”. For the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”.  “Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you,” my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door, “and he looks pretty official. He’s even wearing a fancy suit with a shiny yellow bowtie. Don’t worry though, he assured me you’ve done nothing wrong.” “Yellow!” screeched the frog.“What?” asked my mom.“Oh, I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she said.“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I said nervously. “Oh. I didn’t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,” she said, getting even closer to the door, “because that’s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.”  I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house. The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house.

But here I am!” Soy shouted. Tyrt stood up too, but as a fairy, it didn’t have the dramatic effect that he had intended. “Soy, just calm down,” I said to him. "They’re trying to help us.”“They’re the whole reason we’re in this mess,” Soy said gruffly. “How do we even know that we belong here?” Soy had made a pretty good point. It seemed that Ream was only interested in us because Deli was, and she still hadn’t shown us any evidence that either Soy or I was the hero. For a moment, I thought that maybe everything was a mistake, and that we might be able to end this all and go home. The thought didn’t make me sad, but it didn’t make me happy either. “I believe we can answer that,” said Deli from my shoulder.As she hopped onto the table in front of Tryt, she spoke only to him. “It’s time to show them,” she asserted.  Tryt’s face told me that he wasn’t thrilled about the idea. He wore the same expression that I had when my mom insisted that I do my homework right when I got home. I knew that she was right, and that it wasn’t her fault she was right, but still… harumph. Tryt raised one of his neon pink wings and motioned some fairies over, using it like an arm. Four fairies came flying in from the side of the courtyard opposite from where we entered. They were carrying a large, dark brown book. These fairies had on medieval-looking armor made from the same glass as the chairs. The book they were carrying was thicker than a dictionary and wider. It was the kind of book that Soy would have openly protested if we had been assigned to read it for our class.*It also seemed that the book was heavier than it looked, since the fairies were out of breath by the time they put it down on the table. Tryt shooed them away with his wing, and they disappeared straight up and out of the courtyard.  *Soy once proclaimed that making kids reading anything over one hundred pages was technically illegal, but he never found the documents to support it. When the fairies left, Soy and I stood up at the same time to inspect. It was a dusty, rundown book. There were no words on the cover, but it was hard to say whether they had rubbed off, or were just never there at all. Along the center, a buckle with a lock ran horizontally across, made of the strange yellowish-gold that I now knew. “Stonegold?” I asked.“Yes,” said Tryt, “only a magic pen may write in the Book of Lore, but it does not hurt to be safe.” “Why would anybody want to mess with the book?” asked Soy.“The Book of Lore chronicles every fairytale throughout history. Changing them would change the fate of the world,” answered Tryt indignantly. Soy didn’t respond this time.  All four of us gathered closer, hovering over the book as Tryt held up his shiny pen. Without a word, he turned it over, placed the crown on top inside the stonegold lock and turned it. The buckle surrendered, opening up with a low hiss. I thought the pages smelled like pine trees, but didn’t say it out loud. Tryt began flipping through the book and it was hard to see the words. Whenever I did catch a glimpse, the writing started off hard to focus on, but then got more clear. The words were written in fancy, old looking letters.Soy’s face was getting closer and closer to the pages by the second.  “It’s in English,” he said finally, “I thought it might be in fairy or elvish, or something weird like that.” Tryt didn’t look up to acknowledge Soy, but it was obvious from his voice that he was agitated. “It is not ‘in English’. The fairytales in the Book of Lore appear in the first language of whomever is reading it,” he said. “That’s English,” said Soy, pointing at the book.“Soy, to you it is in English, but to someone else it may be in French or German,” said Deli. “If it was in French of German, I wouldn’t be able to read it,” Soy explained politely, “so that’s how I know it’s in English.” Tryt let out an un-fairylike grunt and continued flipping through the pages while he spoke. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-netboard-2-0')};“The characters in these stories had their fates sealed by the outcomes written here. But Ream’s first fairytale is unique in its ending.”“Ream was in a fairytale?” I asked with surprise. That seemed like a big deal to me. “Yes," Tryt replied. "When a hero or heroine defeats a villain, their story and their fate are sealed within this book. All the rile of those defeated, all of their magic, is confined within the book so that they may never use it against the world again. And every villain inside the Book of Lore was defeated, save one." “Ream,” I said gravely. “Yes,” replied Deli, “instead of defeat, his tale ended with an escape. That is why he was able to hold onto his rile.”“He was injured. Pierced with stonegold, to be exact,” Tryt said as he slowed his page turning. “And once stonegold pierces you, it may never be removed or covered. That is why Ream always has a piece of stonegold visible, regardless of his disguise." “But nobody has explained yet why he’s after us,” said Soy. “We didn’t do anything to him!” “You’re not a patient child, are you, Soy?” asked Tryt in a half-question.“And you don’t own a bookmark,” rebutted Soy, not at all in the form of a question.  Tryt turned one last page, then covered it with his fairyhand, unleashing a slew of sparkles that shot out to conceal the center. “This is your fairytale. And this is the reason that Ream is after you,” Tryt said, looking directly at me. “It may be the last fairytale ever written. All the fairytales that came before it, and all the creatures inside of them are at stake. Ream and the forces of rile are trying to change their fate.” “But, why are you calling it mine?” I asked shyly. Deli looked up at me. “Because you are the hero,” she replied. Tryt moved his hand, and the sparkles flew away. Written on the page in a thousand languages, but English to me, was the title: The Boy and The Flying Bed. And underneath it, there was a small drawing. Tyrt stood up too, but as a fairy, it didn’t have the dramatic effect that he had intended. “Soy, just calm down,” I said to him.

And every villain inside the Book of Lore was defeated, save one." “Ream,” I said gravely. “Yes,” replied Deli, “instead of defeat, his tale ended with an escape. That is why he was able to hold onto his rile.”“He was injured. Pierced with stonegold, to be exact,” Tryt said as he slowed his page turning. “And once stonegold pierces you, it may never be removed or covered. That is why Ream always has a piece of stonegold visible, regardless of his disguise." “But nobody has explained yet why he’s after us,” said Soy. “We didn’t do anything to him!” “You’re not a patient child, are you, Soy?” asked Tryt in a half-question.“And you don’t own a bookmark,” rebutted Soy, not at all in the form of a question.  Tryt turned one last page, then covered it with his fairyhand, unleashing a slew of sparkles that shot out to conceal the center. “This is your fairytale. And this is the reason that Ream is after you,” Tryt said, looking directly at me. “It may be the last fairytale ever written. All the fairytales that came before it, and all the creatures inside of them are at stake. Ream and the forces of rile are trying to change their fate.” “But, why are you calling it mine?” I asked shyly. Deli looked up at me. “Because you are the hero,” she replied. Tryt moved his hand, and the sparkles flew away. Written on the page in a thousand languages, but English to me, was the title: The Boy and The Flying Bed. And underneath it, there was a small drawing. “Soy, just calm down,” I said to him. "They’re trying to help us.”“They’re the whole reason we’re in this mess,” Soy said gruffly. “How do we even know that we belong here?” Soy had made a pretty good point. It seemed that Ream was only interested in us because Deli was, and she still hadn’t shown us any evidence that either Soy or I was the hero. For a moment, I thought that maybe everything was a mistake, and that we might be able to end this all and go home. The thought didn’t make me sad, but it didn’t make me happy either. “I believe we can answer that,” said Deli from my shoulder.As she hopped onto the table in front of Tryt, she spoke only to him. “It’s time to show them,” she asserted.  Tryt’s face told me that he wasn’t thrilled about the idea. He wore the same expression that I had when my mom insisted that I do my homework right when I got home. I knew that she was right, and that it wasn’t her fault she was right, but still… harumph. Tryt raised one of his neon pink wings and motioned some fairies over, using it like an arm. Four fairies came flying in from the side of the courtyard opposite from where we entered. They were carrying a large, dark brown book. These fairies had on medieval-looking armor made from the same glass as the chairs. The book they were carrying was thicker than a dictionary and wider. It was the kind of book that Soy would have openly protested if we had been assigned to read it for our class.*It also seemed that the book was heavier than it looked, since the fairies were out of breath by the time they put it down on the table. Tryt shooed them away with his wing, and they disappeared straight up and out of the courtyard.  *Soy once proclaimed that making kids reading anything over one hundred pages was technically illegal, but he never found the documents to support it. When the fairies left, Soy and I stood up at the same time to inspect. It was a dusty, rundown book. There were no words on the cover, but it was hard to say whether they had rubbed off, or were just never there at all. Along the center, a buckle with a lock ran horizontally across, made of the strange yellowish-gold that I now knew. “Stonegold?” I asked.“Yes,” said Tryt, “only a magic pen may write in the Book of Lore, but it does not hurt to be safe.” “Why would anybody want to mess with the book?” asked Soy.“The Book of Lore chronicles every fairytale throughout history. Changing them would change the fate of the world,” answered Tryt indignantly. Soy didn’t respond this time.  All four of us gathered closer, hovering over the book as Tryt held up his shiny pen. Without a word, he turned it over, placed the crown on top inside the stonegold lock and turned it. The buckle surrendered, opening up with a low hiss. I thought the pages smelled like pine trees, but didn’t say it out loud. Tryt began flipping through the book and it was hard to see the words. Whenever I did catch a glimpse, the writing started off hard to focus on, but then got more clear. The words were written in fancy, old looking letters.Soy’s face was getting closer and closer to the pages by the second.  “It’s in English,” he said finally, “I thought it might be in fairy or elvish, or something weird like that.” Tryt didn’t look up to acknowledge Soy, but it was obvious from his voice that he was agitated. “It is not ‘in English’. The fairytales in the Book of Lore appear in the first language of whomever is reading it,” he said. “That’s English,” said Soy, pointing at the book.“Soy, to you it is in English, but to someone else it may be in French or German,” said Deli. “If it was in French of German, I wouldn’t be able to read it,” Soy explained politely, “so that’s how I know it’s in English.” Tryt let out an un-fairylike grunt and continued flipping through the pages while he spoke. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-netboard-2-0')};“The characters in these stories had their fates sealed by the outcomes written here.

"When a hero or heroine defeats a villain, their story and their fate are sealed within this book. All the rile of those defeated, all of their magic, is confined within the book so that they may never use it against the world again. And every villain inside the Book of Lore was defeated, save one." “Ream,” I said gravely. “Yes,” replied Deli, “instead of defeat, his tale ended with an escape. That is why he was able to hold onto his rile.”“He was injured. Pierced with stonegold, to be exact,” Tryt said as he slowed his page turning. “And once stonegold pierces you, it may never be removed or covered. That is why Ream always has a piece of stonegold visible, regardless of his disguise." “But nobody has explained yet why he’s after us,” said Soy. “We didn’t do anything to him!” “You’re not a patient child, are you, Soy?” asked Tryt in a half-question.“And you don’t own a bookmark,” rebutted Soy, not at all in the form of a question.  Tryt turned one last page, then covered it with his fairyhand, unleashing a slew of sparkles that shot out to conceal the center. “This is your fairytale. And this is the reason that Ream is after you,” Tryt said, looking directly at me. “It may be the last fairytale ever written. All the fairytales that came before it, and all the creatures inside of them are at stake. Ream and the forces of rile are trying to change their fate.” “But, why are you calling it mine?” I asked shyly. Deli looked up at me. “Because you are the hero,” she replied. Tryt moved his hand, and the sparkles flew away. Written on the page in a thousand languages, but English to me, was the title: The Boy and The Flying Bed. And underneath it, there was a small drawing. These fairies had on medieval-looking armor made from the same glass as the chairs. The book they were carrying was thicker than a dictionary and wider. It was the kind of book that Soy would have openly protested if we had been assigned to read it for our class.*It also seemed that the book was heavier than it looked, since the fairies were out of breath by the time they put it down on the table. Tryt shooed them away with his wing, and they disappeared straight up and out of the courtyard.  *Soy once proclaimed that making kids reading anything over one hundred pages was technically illegal, but he never found the documents to support it. When the fairies left, Soy and I stood up at the same time to inspect. It was a dusty, rundown book. There were no words on the cover, but it was hard to say whether they had rubbed off, or were just never there at all. Along the center, a buckle with a lock ran horizontally across, made of the strange yellowish-gold that I now knew. “Stonegold?” I asked.“Yes,” said Tryt, “only a magic pen may write in the Book of Lore, but it does not hurt to be safe.” “Why would anybody want to mess with the book?” asked Soy.“The Book of Lore chronicles every fairytale throughout history. Changing them would change the fate of the world,” answered Tryt indignantly. Soy didn’t respond this time.  All four of us gathered closer, hovering over the book as Tryt held up his shiny pen. Without a word, he turned it over, placed the crown on top inside the stonegold lock and turned it. The buckle surrendered, opening up with a low hiss. I thought the pages smelled like pine trees, but didn’t say it out loud. Tryt began flipping through the book and it was hard to see the words. Whenever I did catch a glimpse, the writing started off hard to focus on, but then got more clear. The words were written in fancy, old looking letters.Soy’s face was getting closer and closer to the pages by the second.  “It’s in English,” he said finally, “I thought it might be in fairy or elvish, or something weird like that.” Tryt didn’t look up to acknowledge Soy, but it was obvious from his voice that he was agitated. “It is not ‘in English’.

Written on the page in a thousand languages, but English to me, was the title: The Boy and The Flying Bed. And underneath it, there was a small drawing. “Why would anybody want to mess with the book?” asked Soy.“The Book of Lore chronicles every fairytale throughout history. Changing them would change the fate of the world,” answered Tryt indignantly. Soy didn’t respond this time.  All four of us gathered closer, hovering over the book as Tryt held up his shiny pen. Without a word, he turned it over, placed the crown on top inside the stonegold lock and turned it. The buckle surrendered, opening up with a low hiss. I thought the pages smelled like pine trees, but didn’t say it out loud. Tryt began flipping through the book and it was hard to see the words. Whenever I did catch a glimpse, the writing started off hard to focus on, but then got more clear. The words were written in fancy, old looking letters.Soy’s face was getting closer and closer to the pages by the second.  “It’s in English,” he said finally, “I thought it might be in fairy or elvish, or something weird like that.” Tryt didn’t look up to acknowledge Soy, but it was obvious from his voice that he was agitated. “It is not ‘in English’. The fairytales in the Book of Lore appear in the first language of whomever is reading it,” he said. “That’s English,” said Soy, pointing at the book.“Soy, to you it is in English, but to someone else it may be in French or German,” said Deli. “If it was in French of German, I wouldn’t be able to read it,” Soy explained politely, “so that’s how I know it’s in English.” Tryt let out an un-fairylike grunt and continued flipping through the pages while he spoke. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-netboard-2-0')};“The characters in these stories had their fates sealed by the outcomes written here. But Ream’s first fairytale is unique in its ending.”“Ream was in a fairytale?” I asked with surprise. That seemed like a big deal to me. “Yes," Tryt replied. "When a hero or heroine defeats a villain, their story and their fate are sealed within this book. All the rile of those defeated, all of their magic, is confined within the book so that they may never use it against the world again. And every villain inside the Book of Lore was defeated, save one." “Ream,” I said gravely. “Yes,” replied Deli, “instead of defeat, his tale ended with an escape. That is why he was able to hold onto his rile.”“He was injured. Pierced with stonegold, to be exact,” Tryt said as he slowed his page turning. “And once stonegold pierces you, it may never be removed or covered. That is why Ream always has a piece of stonegold visible, regardless of his disguise." “But nobody has explained yet why he’s after us,” said Soy. “We didn’t do anything to him!” “You’re not a patient child, are you, Soy?” asked Tryt in a half-question.“And you don’t own a bookmark,” rebutted Soy, not at all in the form of a question.  Tryt turned one last page, then covered it with his fairyhand, unleashing a slew of sparkles that shot out to conceal the center. “This is your fairytale. And this is the reason that Ream is after you,” Tryt said, looking directly at me. “It may be the last fairytale ever written.

All the rile of those defeated, all of their magic, is confined within the book so that they may never use it against the world again.

Instead he fell right back into the snow. He hopped again, even higher this time, but his wings would not work.

It took him days and days to return.     By the time he got back, his wings had almost become unfrozen.When he rubbed them together this time, they made a chirping noise that no one in the forest had ever heard before. And every time he rubbed his wings together they chirped a little bit louder and got a little less frozen. But it is important to know, dear reader, that wings are special and fragile things. This is why the greatest care should always be taken around them. They are not meant to be frozen, and once they are, they may never be the same again.   Even though the cricket’s wings were no longer frozen, he still could not fly. And ever since then the cricket stays on the ground like his friend the ant, and hops from place to place. And now the cricket is the fastest and fanciest hopper there is. At nighttime, you can hear him chirping, from rubbing his wings together to keep warm.But he is doing much more than just that… The cricket is telling you how warm or cold it is by chirping.

However, that is only if you decide to listen…    *Dolbear’s Law states that if you count the number of time a cricket chirps in 15 seconds, and add 40, it will give you (roughly) the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.   By the time he got back, his wings had almost become unfrozen.When he rubbed them together this time, they made a chirping noise that no one in the forest had ever heard before. And every time he rubbed his wings together they chirped a little bit louder and got a little less frozen. But it is important to know, dear reader, that wings are special and fragile things. This is why the greatest care should always be taken around them. They are not meant to be frozen, and once they are, they may never be the same again.   Even though the cricket’s wings were no longer frozen, he still could not fly.

There is so much out there to explore, from polar bears in the arctic to lemurs in the jungle!

Daniel ErricoI went up to the arctic where I met a polar bear.You might think she’d be white, but she had purple yellow hair.I hopped on to a glacier and I rode it out to sea.Snow is great for sledding but it's much too cold for me.if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-box-4-0')};I like to go exploring places that I've never been.Take one step, and then another, that's how you begin.I made it to the jungle where a toucan said “Hello!”He made a hat from branches that he dropped to me below.High above in vines were where the lemurs liked to swing.They jumped around and laughed and that's when they began to sing:We like to go exploring places that we've never been.Take one swing, and then another, that's how we begin.I headed to the desert where the camel keeps his humps.He takes them off and puts them on, his fuzzy camel lumps.We stopped at an oasis, such a magic, mystique spot,But soon I had to leave for it was getting rather hot. I headed to the forest where the trees were made of gum,And if I come that way again, I’ll chew up every one.I hiked up to the mountains where the bobcat had her band. The goats and mountain lions joined the song that they had planned:We like to go exploring places we have never been.Take one step, and then another, that's how we begin.if(typeof

on week after week. Off in the forest, a small cabin stood.The old man had built it with amber black wood. For he was a wizard, named “Sonto the Bad”,Who’d been banished by Robert, good King Michael’s dad. By Sonto’s side, sat his duck and a box,A box with a trio of tri-colored locks. Inside of the box, Sonto locked up the sun.And magic, just magic, could make this undone.But no one had seen the

never shone.The peasants were angry and started to groan. Finally, Michael could take it no more.He would go fix things and settle this score! So rarely did Kings travel solo by horse,But Michael charged on, and he stayed on his course. The council had urged him that east would be best,But the King disagreed, and rode off to the west. The road was not safe, filled with perilous foes,Like armies of warthogs and red forest trolls. He battled these creatures without any fear,In brave, kingly ways that are not mentioned here. One evening the King paused to look at his map,And somehow, instead, he slipped into a nap. He slept rather soundly on leaf-covered ground,And awoke from his dream when he heard a loud sound. When he looked round a tree, Michael spotted the source.“A cabin!” he whispered, and tied up his horse. Up to the window, he creeped and he crept.When he saw the old wizard, he cheered and he lept! “I found you!” he shouted, and burst through the door.(Though a king should know better than manners so poor). He insisted the wizard reverse what he’d done,Then he took back his wish and demanded the sun. “I’d rather eat wormtoads than do what you say,But I offer you this, a small game we can play. Inside of this box lies the magic you seek.”Sonto grinned wide and continued to speak. “Three keys for three locks, are the only way in.Answer three riddles, unlock them and win.But if you should fail, or not answer in time,Your title is forfeit, your kingdom is mine!” A king must be wise to rule over a nation,So, Michael was ready, without hesitation. They both took a seat, and the duck gave a glare.(The King, without knowing, had taken his chair). The box was between them, it sat in the middle.Sonto spoke first, to recite the first riddle. “I climb up a hill and reach out to the sky,And still you are taller- I ask, who am I?” “An ant,” said the king, as the old wizard frowned“Whose hill only sits but an inch off the ground.”  “Sonto the Bad” muttered, “Well…lucky guess.We’ll see how you handle the riddle up next.” “There’s nothing as large, not on land or at sea,But you won’t feel my weight, when you rest under me” The King answered back with the promptest reply,“Enormous and weightless, you must be the sky.” Sonto was mad, he did not like to lose.For last of his riddles, he knew which to choose.Weeks became months, and the sun never

he knew which to choose.But the King disagreed, and rode off to the west. The road was not safe, filled with perilous foes,Like armies of warthogs and red forest trolls. He battled these creatures without any fear,In brave, kingly ways that are not mentioned here. One evening the King paused to look at his map,And somehow, instead, he slipped into a nap. He slept rather soundly on leaf-covered ground,And awoke from his dream when he heard a loud sound. When he looked round a tree, Michael spotted the source.“A cabin!” he whispered, and tied up his horse. Up to the window, he creeped and he crept.When he saw the old wizard, he cheered and he lept! “I found you!” he shouted, and burst through the door.(Though a king should know better than manners so poor). He insisted the wizard reverse what he’d done,Then he took back his wish and demanded the sun. “I’d rather eat wormtoads than do what you say,But I offer you this, a small game we can play. Inside of this box lies the magic you seek.”Sonto grinned wide and continued to speak. “Three keys for three locks, are the only way in.Answer three riddles, unlock them and win.But if you should fail, or not answer in time,Your title is forfeit, your kingdom is mine!” A king must be wise to rule over a nation,So, Michael was ready, without hesitation. They both took a seat, and the duck gave a glare.(The King, without knowing, had taken his chair). The box was between them, it sat in the middle.Sonto spoke first, to recite the first riddle. “I climb up a hill and reach out to the sky,And still you are taller- I ask, who am I?” “An ant,” said the king, as the old wizard frowned“Whose hill only sits but an inch off the ground.”  “Sonto the Bad” muttered, “Well…lucky guess.We’ll see how you handle the riddle up next.” “There’s nothing as large, not on land or at sea,But you won’t feel my weight, when you rest under me” The King answered back with the promptest reply,“Enormous and weightless, you must be the

Written by Daniel ErricoIllustrated by Ricky AudiIllustrated by Ricky AudiBefore words were words, a boy named Yes lived in a small village in a small kingdom. Yes was good at everything. He was the best, smartest and most liked person in his village. Yes had a brother, and his name was No. No was jealous of his brother, because he was not much good at anything himself. Whenever the villagers asked No for help, he refused because he didn’t like people very much.  Whenever someone asked Yes for a favor, he would gladly help, and he secretly didn’t mind the fact that it irritated No when he did.Yes had a brother, and his name was No. No was jealous of his brother, because he was not much good at anything himself.

Yes took good care of the great guck, and the icks, and the three-toed yock. [Keep in mind, my dear friend, that the guck, ick, and three-toed yock were very old animals, so you might know them by different names today.] No didn’t want to be bothered with the boring tasks involved with taking care of the animals. So instead of helping his brother, No went down to the lake and threw rocks into the water. One day Yes and No’s father, Okay went on a long journey and he left his two sons in charge of all the animals.

So instead of helping his brother, No went down to the lake and threw rocks into the water. A few days after his father left, Yes asked his brother to watch the three-toed yock while he went to find some food to eat. Instead of doing what Yes asked, No lay down, shut his eyes, and forgot about the yock.A few days after his father left, Yes asked his brother to watch the three-toed yock while he went to find some food to eat. Instead of doing what Yes asked, No lay down, shut his eyes, and forgot about the yock.It just so happened that the King had a personal road nearby, and he traveled on it often.  So often, that when the three-toed yock wandered onto the road, the King’s carriage was passing by and had to swerve to avoid hitting it.  The King was thrown from the carriage and fell to the ground and hurt himself.The King demanded to know why a three-toed yock had been allowed on his road and asked all the villagers for an explanation. Yes was always honest, so he told the King the entire story.The King thought for a moment, and then he came up with an idea that he was quite happy with. Yes and No were to work in the castle as his personal assistants as punishment for what was later referred to as the worst three-toed yock and carriage accident in the Kingdom’s history.It just so happened that the King had a personal road nearby, and he traveled on it often.  So often, that when the three-toed yock wandered onto the road, the King’s carriage was passing by and had to swerve to avoid hitting it.  The King was thrown from the carriage and fell to the ground and hurt himself.The King demanded to know why a three-toed yock had been allowed on his road and asked all the villagers for an explanation.

The King was quite sure that No was the worst servant in the entire world. The King needed help with many things around the castle because a King cannot be bothered with the daily tasks involved with running a Kingdom.  However, soon after his decision about the two brothers, the King realized that only Yes would be of any use to him as a servant.  Whenever the King asked No to bring him anything, it would get thrown away, broken, or eaten, without exception.

Cooks from all over the Kingdom lined up at the castle’s gate to offer the King their food for the party.  Of course, the King could not go and grab the food himself, so he asked Yes and No to do it for him.The first cook came up the gate and yelled to the Gatekeeper, “I bring my delicious ugberry pie for the King’s banquet!”  The King heard this and thought that ugberry pie would be perfect for such an event (and he would love to eat the leftovers). He didn’t want anything to happen to the ugberry pie, so he yelled “Yes!” and then asked him to go fetch it.The brothers’ most important task was to help pick the food for a grand party that the King was throwing later that night.

 Dennis didn’t feel like sleeping. He had gone to bed at the same time every night for as long ashe could remember. He was tired (not sleepy-tired, more like sick and tired) of going to bedwhen his parents told him to. So one night, when fall seemed over, but it wasn’t yet winter, hedecided he would stay up!What Dennis didn’t realize, is that staying awake at night is hard when your body needs tosleep. He tried everything he could think of to stop himself from falling asleep. He tried counting wolves (if counting sheep makes you sleepy, then counting wolves must surely do the opposite), but unfortunately it made him even more tired. He started to suspect that it was the counting, and not the choice of animal, that made people sleepy.He tried holding his eyelids open, but that was difficult and altogether odd-looking. He even tried doing math problems in his head to stay awake, but the only thing more boring than solving math problems is trying to think of math problems to solve.Dennis was just about ready to give up when he heard a faint squeak from his hamster Charlie.He went over to Charlie’s cage, but it was empty. Dennis followed the sounds of squeaking until he found Charlie on the floor, looking behind the dresser. Dennis noticed that something back there was throwing things at Charlie! Paperclips, balls of paper, and even some legos were flying in Charlie’s direction, as he squeaked.“What’s there, Charlie?” Dennis asked as he picked up the hamster and peered around behindthe dresser.What he saw made him wonder if he had actually fallen asleep and not realized it.“It’s a ... it’s a gnome!” he said. No bigger than Charlie (and no smaller), the gnome wore ayellow shirt, a tiny pair of green pants, and pointy hat. Had it not been for the pointy hat, Dennis might not have recognized it as a gnome. But, gnome or not, it was being quite rude to Charlie.“Why are you throwing things at my hamster, gnome?” asked Dennis.“Why do you keep a vicious beast as a pet, human?” asked the gnome.“Charlie is not vicious!” answered Dennis.“Yes he is, and he started it.”Charlie squeaked in protest.“More importantly, why are you in my room, gnome?” asked Dennis.“That is highly classified information, human.”“My name is not ‘human’, it’s Dennis.” he said angrily.“I already know your name. And for your information, gnomes have names too!”Dennis didn’t say anything for a moment, and neither did the gnome. It was an awkward silencefor everyone except Charlie who, as usual, had fallen asleep shortly after Dennis picked him up.“Well, what is your name then?” asked Dennis.What Dennis didn’t realize, is that staying awake at night is hard when your body needs tosleep.

Paperclips, balls of paper, and even some legos were flying in Charlie’s direction, as he squeaked.“What’s there, Charlie?” Dennis asked as he picked up the hamster and peered around behindthe dresser.What he saw made him wonder if he had actually fallen asleep and not realized it.“It’s a ... it’s a gnome!” he said. No bigger than Charlie (and no smaller), the gnome wore ayellow shirt, a tiny pair of green pants, and pointy hat. Had it not been for the pointy hat, Dennis might not have recognized it as a gnome. But, gnome or not, it was being quite rude to Charlie.“Why are you throwing things at my hamster, gnome?” asked Dennis.“Why do you keep a vicious beast as a pet, human?” asked the gnome.“Charlie is not vicious!” answered Dennis.“Yes he is, and he started it.”Charlie squeaked in protest.“More importantly, why are you in my room, gnome?” asked Dennis.“That is highly classified information, human.”“My name is not ‘human’, it’s Dennis.” he said angrily.“I already know your name. And for your information, gnomes have names too!”Dennis didn’t say anything for a moment, and neither did the gnome.

It was an awkward silencefor everyone except Charlie who, as usual, had fallen asleep shortly after Dennis picked him up.“Well, what is your name then?” asked Dennis. “It’s DC. And, I suppose,” said DC begrudgingly, “I should thank you for saving me from thebeast,” said DC.Dennis was still having trouble thinking of the the furry little hamster who was snoring in ishands as a beast, but he still replied, “You’re welcome,” anyway.“You were supposed to be asleep hours ago,” said DC, “and now you’ve seen me. This is bad...this is very bad. I have no choice but to bring you back to the factory.”“What factory?” asked Dennis.“The dream factory,” answered DC.The gnome crawled up the dresser and opened up Dennis’ sock drawer. He rummaged throughuntil he found the sock he was looking for. “Oh, I lost the other sock to that pair,” said Dennisshyly.“I wouldn’t say ‘lost’,” replied DC as he climbed inside the sock and disappeared. Dennis wasastonished. He had watched DC crawl into the sock, and now he was gone! He picked up thesock and looked inside, but there was nothing in there. A moment later DC came crawling backout, tugging a large piece of cloth behind him.“You see,” said DC, “The only way to get to the dream factory is by sock. You go in one sockand come out the other. Since you are a human, you can’t fit in a regular sock, so I brought ourfreight sock with me.”As he spoke, DC pulled out a sock the size of a bed. The huge sock was made up of manysmaller socks sewn together. “Socks?! How can I go in one sock and come out of another?” Dennis asked.“It’s simple,” DC said, “every sock was created with an identical mate- another sock that it isnaturally connected to. Just like you have two feet that are separate, but are both connected to each other through you. Well, the socks we use to travel are connected through magic. All we have to do is get one sock (usually we take them from the washer or dryer) and then we can create a passage way to its partner sock.”Dennis was still confused. Confused in the way you are when a gnome tells you your socks aremagic.“That last part is not as simple- it’s handled by our Autosock Magical Recalibration Division, and the guys who work there are an odd bunch. Anyway, the result is that you go in one sock, and you will always come out the other. That way we can travel from the factory to your home with ease.”“But, that doesn’t tell me anything! Like why do you need to come here at all, and what is at this factory?” asked Dennis.“Ah,” said DC, holding open the enormous sock, “climb inside. You’re about to find out.”Dennis crawled inside the huge sock nervously. It was dark, but smelled much nicer than he had imagined it would (had it smelled anything like his father’s socks, he would have turned around immediately). Dennis didn’t get far before he started to slide. He slid for what seemed like a minute, going faster and faster until he flew out into a large room onto a huge pile of pillows. DC was already in the room beside the pillows, ready to greet him.“It’s DC. And, I suppose,” said DC begrudgingly, “I should thank you for saving me from thebeast,” said DC.Dennis was still having trouble thinking of the the furry little hamster who was snoring in ishands as a beast, but he still replied, “You’re welcome,” anyway.“You were supposed to be asleep hours ago,” said DC, “and now you’ve seen me.

DC was already in the room beside the pillows, ready to greet him. “Welcome to the Dream Factory. This is the Transportation Room. Those socks you seehanging up there are the socks we use for incoming and outgoing trips.”A group of gnomes, who were busy working around the room when Dennis flew in, had nowstopped what they were doing and crowded around.“It’s best if we get going,” said DC, as he led Dennis out of the Transportation Room and into alarge hallway.“This is the Executive Wing. All of the higher-ups have their offices on the other side of thesedoors,” said DC.“What are all of these paintings?” asked Dennis.“Those are paintings of some of Remmy’s favorite dreams, collected over thousands of years.Remmy is in charge of the factory and all the dreams in the entire world. That is who I’m takingyou to see.”“All the colors are so dark, doesn’t he like any nice dreams?” asked Dennis.DC paused for a moment and changed his tone.“Remmy doesn’t care much for those types of dreams. He is the inventor of nightmares.”“That’s horrible,” said Dennis, “You don’t have anything to do with nightmares, do you, DC?” “Welcome to the Dream Factory. This is the Transportation Room.

He is the inventor of nightmares.”“That’s horrible,” said Dennis, “You don’t have anything to do with nightmares, do you, DC?”  “Here we are,” DC quickly replied. They had arrived at the end of the large hall and werestanding at the entrance to Remmy’s office. It was the blackest shade of black that Dennis hadever seen. And above it was a sign that read:“All Ye Who Pass This Crest Shall Find Yourself in Waking Rest.” “All Ye Who Pass This Crest Shall Find Yourself in Waking Rest.”  “Should we knock?” asked Dennis. “There’s nothing to knock on,” answered DC, “Remmydoesn’t have a door. I must warn you. Once you walk through that entrance you will feel like you are asleep, but you are not. Do not let your guard down, because Remmy does not like humans, and he can be very devious.” Dennis nodded and followed DC into the darkness.The moment he cleared the opening, Dennis felt as though his eyes had shut. He was certainhe was standing on a bed, and his head felt heavy. He was getting more comfortable and moresleepy by the second. It felt as though a warm blanket had just been put over him (and noamount of wolf-counting or math problems could help him now).“Who have you brought with you, DC?” asked a soft but sinister voice.“This is Dennis. He was awake when I arrived at his home tonight, and he saved me.”“I see,” said Remmy. “What were you doing awake, Dennis?”Dennis was so tired that he could barely speak. “I ... didn’t want to. Don’t like ... sleeping.”“You don’t like sleeping?” said Remmy a little louder.This woke Dennis up a little bit, and his eyes opened slightly for just a moment. He could barely see what was in front of him, but he thought that he had seen a pair of green eyes.“Well,” continued Remmy in a soothing voice, “You should come work at the factory then. Timestands still while you are here, and you will never have to go to bed, ever again. Doesn’t thatsound perfect?”“Yes,” mumbled Dennis.“But Dennis—“ interjected DC, but he was cut off by Remmy.“Excellent,” said Remmy, “You will start immediately. Show him around, DC.”DC led Dennis back out of the room without him ever really seeing what Remmy looked like. Hecould still barely open his eyes when he stepped back into the hall. DC took him through manyother hallways. By the time Dennis had finally snapped out of it, he was standing on a factoryline in front of a conveyor belt.“Where am I?” he asked.“I told you not to trust him, but you didn’t listen!” said DC. “You’re on the factory line becauseyou told Remmy you’d work here!”“Oh no,” thought Dennis. “What am I going to do?” he asked.“There’s nothing you can do. You just accepted his job offer. Once the paperwork goes through,you will be bound to the factory forever. Your job is on the dream factory line, bottling dreams.I’m sorry.” said DC, and Dennis could tell that he meant it.“I can’t stay here. I’ve got to stop that paperwork!” cried Dennis.“Who’s this, DC?” asked a gnome with a black beard.“This is Dennis,” he answered, “Remmy just assigned him here. He’s going to be working foryou.”“Ah, a new employee! I’m not used to such a large worker, but the bigger they are the longerthey can work, I always say! My name is Foreman, and I’m your boss. Come on, I’ll show youhow it works, kid.” Foreman started to lead Dennis away.“I’ll do what I can to get you out of here ... til then play along,” DC whispered and then ran off.“Your job is to be a dream-mixer. You mix a dream, pour it in a bottle, then set it on the conveyor belt. It’s as simple as that.”“How do you mix a dream?”“Excellent question! Now listen up because I will only tell you once,” said Foreman. “There arethree main ingredients to a dream mix. Once it gets delivered to a person it mixes with their own memories and thoughts to make a dream. All they need to do is take one sniff of it. It’s really quite extraordinary. Over here we have the feelings station. Feelings are the first ingredient.”Foreman showed Dennis dozens of buckets with powder inside them, next to a large machinethat was smashing cubes into a fine powder.“That machine there is what we like to call the Dream Crusher. The gnomes from the FeelingsLaboratory bring us blocks of pure feelings, and we crush them down into a powder, becauseone dash is more than enough for a dream. We have happiness, sadness, love, boredom, oranything else out there. If you can feel it, you can dream it! Unfortunately, ever since Remmy’sbeen in charge we’ve had to put fear into dreams sometimes too. Anyway, you sprinkle a littlepowder into the bottle and you’re ready for the next step. I hope you’re following.”Dennis nodded, as Foreman showed him a stand with different colored liquids in it.“Good. The next ingredient is color. You pick any colors you want. Light colors, dark colors,weird colors, dull colors, or my favorite- colors that really don’t go together. Then you scoopthem into the bottle with this ladle. The person who gets that mix will see those colors in theirdream. Got it?”Dennis nodded again.“Good, now you’re ready for the last ingredient: peppermint.”“Peppermint?” asked Dennis.“Yep, peppermint. You take a little peppermint from this container here, and you’re ready to cork the bottle and put it on the belt. Good luck. Now I’ve gotta go check on some other employees.”Dennis was nodding in a daze.“Gidget, for the last time that is way too much peppermint!” yelled Foreman as he walked awayto scold a confused-looking gnome.Dennis was starting to wish that he had gone to sleep at his bedtime. Anything would be betterthan being forced by gnomes to work on a factory line.“I’ve got to find a way out of this place,” thought Dennis. “What I need is a diversion. I need tosomething to distract Foreman!”It was hard for him to think with the Dream Crusher making so much noise.“I’ve got it!” he said.That was the moment when Dennis decided he was going to make his very first, and hopefullyvery last, dream mix.He looked through all the buckets of feelings and found the perfect one. It was labeled:“confusion”.He sprinkled a large amount of the confusion powder into a bottle. Next he poured his favoritecolors inside: blue, green, and white. He was about to put the cork in until he remembered thelast ingredient.“I almost forgot the peppermint!” he said.A dash of peppermint later, and he had made a dream mix, corked and ready to be put on theconveyor belt. But that’s not where he put it. Instead, Dennis snuck over to the Dream Crusher,tossed the bottle inside, and went back over to the conveyor belt. The moment he cleared the opening, Dennis felt as though his eyes had shut. He was certainhe was standing on a bed, and his head felt heavy. He was getting more comfortable and moresleepy by the second. It felt as though a warm blanket had just been put over him (and noamount of wolf-counting or math problems could help him now).“Who have you brought with you, DC?” asked a soft but sinister voice.“This is Dennis. He was awake when I arrived at his home tonight, and he saved me.”“I see,” said Remmy. “What were you doing awake, Dennis?”Dennis was so tired that he could barely speak. “I ... didn’t want to. Don’t like ... sleeping.”“You don’t like sleeping?” said Remmy a little louder.This woke Dennis up a little bit, and his eyes opened slightly for just a moment. He could barely see what was in front of him, but he thought that he had seen a pair of green eyes.“Well,” continued Remmy in a soothing voice, “You should come work at the factory then. Timestands still while you are here, and you will never have to go to bed, ever again. Doesn’t thatsound perfect?”“Yes,” mumbled Dennis.“But Dennis—“ interjected DC, but he was cut off by Remmy.“Excellent,” said Remmy, “You will start immediately. Show him around, DC.”DC led Dennis back out of the room without him ever really seeing what Remmy looked like. Hecould still barely open his eyes when he stepped back into the hall. DC took him through manyother hallways. By the time Dennis had finally snapped out of it, he was standing on a factoryline in front of a conveyor belt.“Where am I?” he asked.“I told you not to trust him, but you didn’t listen!” said DC. “You’re on the factory line becauseyou told Remmy you’d work here!”“Oh no,” thought Dennis. “What am I going to do?” he asked.“There’s nothing you can do. You just accepted his job offer. Once the paperwork goes through,you will be bound to the factory forever. Your job is on the dream factory line, bottling dreams.I’m sorry.” said DC, and Dennis could tell that he meant it.“I can’t stay here. I’ve got to stop that paperwork!” cried Dennis.“Who’s this, DC?” asked a gnome with a black beard.“This is Dennis,” he answered, “Remmy just assigned him here. He’s going to be working foryou.”“Ah, a new employee! I’m not used to such a large worker, but the bigger they are the longerthey can work, I always say! My name is Foreman, and I’m your boss. Come on, I’ll show youhow it works, kid.” Foreman started to lead Dennis away.“I’ll do what I can to get you out of here ... til then play along,” DC whispered and then ran off.“Your job is to be a dream-mixer. You mix a dream, pour it in a bottle, then set it on the conveyor belt. It’s as simple as that.”“How do you mix a dream?”“Excellent question! Now listen up because I will only tell you once,” said Foreman. “There arethree main ingredients to a dream mix. Once it gets delivered to a person it mixes with their own memories and thoughts to make a dream. All they need to do is take one sniff of it. It’s really quite extraordinary. Over here we have the feelings station. Feelings are the first ingredient.”Foreman showed Dennis dozens of buckets with powder inside them, next to a large machinethat was smashing cubes into a fine powder.“That machine there is what we like to call the Dream Crusher. The gnomes from the FeelingsLaboratory bring us blocks of pure feelings, and we crush them down into a powder, becauseone dash is more than enough for a dream. We have happiness, sadness, love, boredom, oranything else out there. If you can feel it, you can dream it! Unfortunately, ever since Remmy’sbeen in charge we’ve had to put fear into dreams sometimes too. Anyway, you sprinkle a littlepowder into the bottle and you’re ready for the next step. I hope you’re following.”Dennis nodded, as Foreman showed him a stand with different colored liquids in it.“Good. The next ingredient is color. You pick any colors you want. Light colors, dark colors,weird colors, dull colors, or my favorite- colors that really don’t go together. Then you scoopthem into the bottle with this ladle. The person who gets that mix will see those colors in theirdream. Got it?”Dennis nodded again.“Good, now you’re ready for the last ingredient: peppermint.”“Peppermint?” asked Dennis.“Yep, peppermint. You take a little peppermint from this container here, and you’re ready to cork the bottle and put it on the belt. Good luck. Now I’ve gotta go check on some other employees.”Dennis was nodding in a daze.“Gidget, for the last time that is way too much peppermint!” yelled Foreman as he walked awayto scold a confused-looking gnome.Dennis was starting to wish that he had gone to sleep at his bedtime. Anything would be betterthan being forced by gnomes to work on a factory line.“I’ve got to find a way out of this place,” thought Dennis. “What I need is a diversion. I need tosomething to distract Foreman!”It was hard for him to think with the Dream Crusher making so much noise.“I’ve got it!” he said.That was the moment when Dennis decided he was going to make his very first, and hopefullyvery last, dream mix.He looked through all the buckets of feelings and found the perfect one. It was labeled:“confusion”.He sprinkled a large amount of the confusion powder into a bottle. Next he poured his favoritecolors inside: blue, green, and white. He was about to put the cork in until he remembered thelast ingredient.“I almost forgot the peppermint!” he said.A dash of peppermint later, and he had made a dream mix, corked and ready to be put on theconveyor belt. But that’s not where he put it. Instead, Dennis snuck over to the Dream Crusher,tossed the bottle inside, and went back over to the conveyor belt. “Who have you brought with you, DC?” asked a soft but sinister voice.“This is Dennis. He was awake when I arrived at his home tonight, and he saved me.”“I see,” said Remmy. “What were you doing awake, Dennis?”Dennis was so tired that he could barely speak. “I ... didn’t want to. Don’t like ... sleeping.”“You don’t like sleeping?” said Remmy a little louder.This woke Dennis up a little bit, and his eyes opened slightly for just a moment.

But that’s not where he put it. Instead, Dennis snuck over to the Dream Crusher,tossed the bottle inside, and went back over to the conveyor belt.  A few seconds later the Dream Crusher came crashing down. When the bottle broke, the dream mix was released and filled the entire room. Dennis was the only one holding his breath.Instantly, all of the gnomes stopped working. They were much too confused to get anythingdone.Some of them bumped into each other, but most of them just walked around in circles.Foreman had stopped yelling at the gnomes. He looked at the peppermint for a few secondsand then, without a word, started eating it.Dennis took the opportunity to hop onto the conveyor belt. It carried him out of the room, into a dark tunnel. He didn’t know where it would lead him, but he couldn’t hold his breath any longer, and had to get out of there (the only other time he had ever held his breath that long was when his father took his shoes off in the car).The tunnel stretched on until the conveyor belt came to an end, dropping him into a huge vat in a large, bright room. He was surrounded by dream mix bottles. When he heard some gnomescoming, Dennis climbed out and hid behind a pile of bags. The sign above the door read,“PACKING ROOM.” The gnomes were singing a song:“Rest your head and close your eyes, meet the sun at morning rise,If a dream is calm and deep, let it find you sound asleep”From behind the bags, Dennis watched the gnomes work. They grabbed bottles from the vatone by one and put them inside of bags, just like the ones he was hiding behind.“The carrier is taking the next batch out soon,” said a female gnome.“I’ll never understand how one gnome can deliver so many dreams, every night!” said a secondgnome.Just then a gnome driving a small car entered the room. The car was towing a bed behind it.The other gnomes loaded bag after bag onto the bed.“Tell the carrier we say hi,” they said to the driver as he started driving away.Dennis saw his chance to get out of the room. He hurried alongside the car, still crouchingbehind the rows of bags. Just before the car exited the room, he hopped on the bed and hidamong the bags. He sunk between two bags and sighed a deep sigh when he realized thatnone of the gnomes had seen him.He couldn’t see where they were headed but he heard the driver whistling the tune that thepacking gnomes were singing. Every once in a while he could hear the driver say hello to agnome as they drove by. After a few minutes, Dennis peaked through a small opening betweenthe bags. He looked at the words above the doors that they passed.The doors he saw said, in order: GNOME RESOURCES, SOCK REPAIR, FEELINGSLABORATORY, CONFERENCE ROOM D, and PAPERWORK APPROVAL.“Paperwork Approval,” thought Dennis, “That’s the one!”After a quick glance around to make sure the coast was clear, Dennis safely jumped off theback of the slowly-moving bed. He ran to the door of the Paperwork Approval Room, and snuckinside as quickly as he could.The room was small, and there was little light. Dennis saw another conveyor belt, but this onewas carrying papers, not bottles. The belt brought the papers in from a hole in the wall on oneside of the room, and took them out through another on the opposite side of the room. Therewas only one gnome inside, and he sat at the conveyor belt, stamping each paper as it passed.“Hello,” said Dennis.The gnome did not say a word. He was the first gnome Dennis had seen that was not wearing a pointy hat. This gnome was a good deal older than the others and wore a vest, tie, and argyle socks. As he continued to stamp, the gnome pointed to a sign on the wall that read:“NO VISITORS”. Some of them bumped into each other, but most of them just walked around in circles.Foreman had stopped yelling at the gnomes. He looked at the peppermint for a few secondsand then, without a word, started eating it.Dennis took the opportunity to hop onto the conveyor belt. It carried him out of the room, into a dark tunnel.

As he continued to stamp, the gnome pointed to a sign on the wall that read:“NO VISITORS”. The tunnel stretched on until the conveyor belt came to an end, dropping him into a huge vat in a large, bright room. He was surrounded by dream mix bottles. When he heard some gnomescoming, Dennis climbed out and hid behind a pile of bags. The sign above the door read,“PACKING ROOM.” The gnomes were singing a song:“Rest your head and close your eyes, meet the sun at morning rise,If a dream is calm and deep, let it find you sound asleep”From behind the bags, Dennis watched the gnomes work. They grabbed bottles from the vatone by one and put them inside of bags, just like the ones he was hiding behind.“The carrier is taking the next batch out soon,” said a female gnome.“I’ll never understand how one gnome can deliver so many dreams, every night!” said a secondgnome.Just then a gnome driving a small car entered the room. The car was towing a bed behind it.The other gnomes loaded bag after bag onto the bed.“Tell the carrier we say hi,” they said to the driver as he started driving away.Dennis saw his chance to get out of the room. He hurried alongside the car, still crouchingbehind the rows of bags. Just before the car exited the room, he hopped on the bed and hidamong the bags. He sunk between two bags and sighed a deep sigh when he realized thatnone of the gnomes had seen him.He couldn’t see where they were headed but he heard the driver whistling the tune that thepacking gnomes were singing. Every once in a while he could hear the driver say hello to agnome as they drove by. After a few minutes, Dennis peaked through a small opening betweenthe bags. He looked at the words above the doors that they passed.The doors he saw said, in order: GNOME RESOURCES, SOCK REPAIR, FEELINGSLABORATORY, CONFERENCE ROOM D, and PAPERWORK APPROVAL.“Paperwork Approval,” thought Dennis, “That’s the one!”After a quick glance around to make sure the coast was clear, Dennis safely jumped off theback of the slowly-moving bed. He ran to the door of the Paperwork Approval Room, and snuckinside as quickly as he could.The room was small, and there was little light. Dennis saw another conveyor belt, but this onewas carrying papers, not bottles. The belt brought the papers in from a hole in the wall on oneside of the room, and took them out through another on the opposite side of the room. Therewas only one gnome inside, and he sat at the conveyor belt, stamping each paper as it passed.“Hello,” said Dennis.The gnome did not say a word.

As he continued to stamp, the gnome pointed to a sign on the wall that read:“NO VISITORS”. “NO VISITORS”.  “Please, sir,” pleaded Dennis, “I need to take a look at those papers. My name is Dennis. If youdon’t mind me asking, who are you?”The gnome continued to stamp as he spoke.“I am the Stamper, and you are distracting me. I have paperwork to stamp and I cannot miss asingle one. I have just enough ink to stamp every single paper for the day, not a drop more andnot a drop less. You cannot look at these papers. No one can. Now stop bothering me before Iyou make me miss.”“Well ... what kind of papers are they?” asked Dennis.“All of the papers from all of the departments in the factory are sent here. Could be gnomecomplaint forms, nap requests, employee contracts- they all come here,” said the Stamper ashe stamped.“Employee contracts! You have to let me look,” said Dennis.“No one may look!” yelled the Stamper. “I don’t even look at them,” he said under his breath, allthe while continuing to stamp.“You don’t look? But, you’re approving them. How can you do that?”“My job is extremely important,” he said, looking quite angry, “all these papers need approving,and without me they would not get approved.”“If you approve everything, then your approvals lose all meaning. You might as well have astamping machine approve them,” said Dennis.“A stamping machine?!” yelled the Stamper as he slammed his stamp down hard onto a paper,”A stamping machine cannot approve papers!”“You’re not even reading them,” answered Dennis, “don’t you think it’s irresponsible? Don’t youthink it’s silly? Don’t you think it’s ... wrong?”The Stamper froze for a few moments, then shook his head and continued stamping again.The door burst open and a dozen gnomes with uniforms came rushing in.They grabbed Dennis and picked him up, carrying him off.“We’ve found you!” said the head gnome. “You’re going to see Remmy.”Dennis shouted and struggled but it was no use.The Stamper had not looked up. As the guards carried Dennis through the doorway, theStamper stamped his last paper of the day, and put his stamp down. Right as the door shut, asingle drop of ink fell from his stamp.The next thing he knew, Dennis was back in Remmy’s dark office, feeling as tired as ever.“We had a deal Dennis. Why did you leave your spot on the factory line? It took us a long timeto fix the mess you made. We had workers with buckets on their heads and dream mixeverywhere,” said Remmy in his sinister voice.Dennis didn’t know what to say. His eyes were feeling very heavy.“And you, DC! You were supposed to keep an eye on him. How could you let this happen?”“I’m sorry, Remmy. I don’t know how it happened,” answered DC.Dennis couldn’t believe it. DC was in the room with him! And he sounded out of breath.“Well, you’re going to regret this Dennis, believe me. Leave it to a human to break the rules ...”Remmy lectured. As he continued, Dennis felt himself fading closer and closer to sleep. He tried his best to keep his eyes open and listen but it was getting harder and harder.DC leaned over and whispered in his ear.“Let yourself fall asleep.”“What?” Dennis whispered back.“It’s the only way. I have your dream mix here. If you fall asleep, he will forced to talk to youinside your dream. It’s the only way to even the playing field,” said DC.Dennis was too tired to argue. He laid down on the soft, bed floor and fell asleep withinseconds. DC popped open the cork off the dream mix and sprinkled some onto Dennis.Inside his dream, Dennis was standing in an open field. There was a dark blue sky and amountain in the background. A moment later Remmy appeared. Dennis could now see himperfectly. He was larger than the other gnomes, with eyes a bright green. His hat was black asnight.“How dare you fall asleep in my presence! Do you really think that you can battle me in a dream.I am Remmy, master of all dreams and creator of nightmares!” yelled Remmy.“I just want to go home,” shouted Dennis, “I don’t want to battle anyone.”“Well, I’m afraid that’s not going to happen. I decide where you go, and you are not leaving.”Shackles appeared out of nowhere and locked around Dennis’ arms and legs.“You see, you will never escape. I can do whatever I want here, all I have to do is imagine it. Ican even be bigger if I want!”Remmy nearly tripled in size right before Dennis’ eyes.“What can you do?!” laughed Remmy.Dennis had to think fast. How could he possibly beat someone as powerful as Remmy. That’swhen he remembered what DC had said, that being in his dream would level the playing field.That must mean that he can imagine things up too!“Well ...” said Dennis. “I can count wolves.”A wolf appeared next to Dennis, growling at Remmy.“Wolves?” asked Remmy with a bit of crack in his voice.“Yes, wolves,” answered DennisRemmy took a step back.“And I can count very high...”Wolves started appearing by the hundreds. Wave after wave, and they all went straight forRemmy.“What are you doing?!” cried Remmy, “Get them away from me!”Remmy ran off with the wolves close behind. The shackles on Dennis disappeared, and hisdream started to fade. He woke up to DC shaking him.“You’ve got to get out of here. Now’s your chance. It looks like Remmy is stuck in a nightmare,”said DC.Dennis didn’t question it. He ran straight out of the room and down the hallway filled withpictures and offices. At the opposite end of the hallway he found the room he was looking for.He opened the door to the Transportation Room and found the enormous homemade sockwhose pair he had traveled through. It was hanging from a clothesline (luckily anything hung on a gnome’s clothesline is easy to reach). Dennis pulled down the sock and climbed inside.After a quick slide, Dennis found himself crawling out of the huge sock in his bedroom. He was relieved to finally be home, but couldn’t relax just yet. As fast as he could, Dennis ripped up the sock.Then, he took all the socks in his drawer, brought them outside, and tossed them into thegarbage can outside. When he got back into his room, he shut the door behind him and got into bed.Charlie was sound asleep in his cage. Dennis could hardly believe what had happened. Just ashe shut his eyes, trying to think of what he would tell his friends he next day, he felt a slight tug on his sheets.“Hi, Dennis,” said DC, as he climbed up onto the bed.“DC! You’re ok!” said Dennis.“Well, I just traveled through your father’s putrid sock, but other than that I’m better than ever,and it’s all thanks to you.”“What do you mean?” asked Dennis.“Remmy is gone. It seems you scared him off. See, Remmy might have created nightmares, buthe had never actually experienced one until you sent those wolves after him. He ran away fromthe factory, and he’s been replaced.”“Replaced?! By who?”“Well according to the Board of Directors, whoever has the most experience with dreams is next in line.”“And who is that?”“The Dream Carrier.”“Who is the Dream Carrier, anyway?” asked Dennis.“Well ... me. That’s what DC stands for.”“You mean you deliver all the dreams to everyone in the world?”“That’s right. And I’ll never have to deliver another nightmare again, now that I’m in charge ofthe factory!”“Oh,” said Dennis, with a sad look on his face. “I’m seriously happy for you. But I guess you’rehere to take me back to the factory, since I wasn’t able to stop the paperwork.”“The funny thing about that,” said DC as he pulled out a piece of paper, “is that the contract was never stamped. First time it’s ever happened. It means the paper’s worthless. You can keep it if you want.”Dennis smiled. “What should I do with it?”“I would line the bottom of Charlie’s cage with it, but really that’s up to you.”“Thanks, DC.” Said Dennis. “Now, if it’s ok with you I’d like to get some sleep.”“Of course,” said DC, “it’s been a long night.”Dennis drifted off to sleep before he could say another word. That night he dreamt of gnomes,and socks, and beautiful colors, and just the slightesthint of peppermint.“I am the Stamper, and you are distracting me. I have paperwork to stamp and I cannot miss asingle one. I have just enough ink to stamp every single paper for the day, not a drop more andnot a drop less. You cannot look at these papers.

Do you really think that you can battle me in a dream.I am Remmy, master of all dreams and creator of nightmares!” yelled Remmy.“I just want to go home,” shouted Dennis, “I don’t want to battle anyone.”“Well, I’m afraid that’s not going to happen. I decide where you go, and you are not leaving.”Shackles appeared out of nowhere and locked around Dennis’ arms and legs.“You see, you will never escape. I can do whatever I want here, all I have to do is imagine it. Ican even be bigger if I want!”Remmy nearly tripled in size right before Dennis’ eyes.“What can you do?!” laughed Remmy.Dennis had to think fast. How could he possibly beat someone as powerful as Remmy. That’swhen he remembered what DC had said, that being in his dream would level the playing field.That must mean that he can imagine things up too!“Well ...” said Dennis. “I can count wolves.”A wolf appeared next to Dennis, growling at Remmy.“Wolves?” asked Remmy with a bit of crack in his voice.“Yes, wolves,” answered DennisRemmy took a step back.“And I can count very high...”Wolves started appearing by the hundreds. Wave after wave, and they all went straight forRemmy.“What are you doing?!” cried Remmy, “Get them away from me!”Remmy ran off with the wolves close behind. The shackles on Dennis disappeared, and hisdream started to fade. He woke up to DC shaking him.“You’ve got to get out of here. Now’s your chance. It looks like Remmy is stuck in a nightmare,”said DC.Dennis didn’t question it. He ran straight out of the room and down the hallway filled withpictures and offices. At the opposite end of the hallway he found the room he was looking for.He opened the door to the Transportation Room and found the enormous homemade sockwhose pair he had traveled through. It was hanging from a clothesline (luckily anything hung on a gnome’s clothesline is easy to reach). Dennis pulled down the sock and climbed inside.After a quick slide, Dennis found himself crawling out of the huge sock in his bedroom. He was relieved to finally be home, but couldn’t relax just yet. As fast as he could, Dennis ripped up the sock.Then, he took all the socks in his drawer, brought them outside, and tossed them into thegarbage can outside. When he got back into his room, he shut the door behind him and got into bed.Charlie was sound asleep in his cage. Dennis could hardly believe what had happened. Just ashe shut his eyes, trying to think of what he would tell his friends he next day, he felt a slight tug on his sheets.“Hi, Dennis,” said DC, as he climbed up onto the bed.“DC! You’re ok!” said Dennis.“Well, I just traveled through your father’s putrid sock, but other than that I’m better than ever,and it’s all thanks to you.”“What do you mean?” asked Dennis.“Remmy is gone. It seems you scared him off. See, Remmy might have created nightmares, buthe had never actually experienced one until you sent those wolves after him. He ran away fromthe factory, and he’s been replaced.”“Replaced?! By who?”“Well according to the Board of Directors, whoever has the most experience with dreams is next in line.”“And who is that?”“The Dream Carrier.”“Who is the Dream Carrier, anyway?” asked Dennis.“Well ... me. That’s what DC stands for.”“You mean you deliver all the dreams to everyone in the world?”“That’s right. And I’ll never have to deliver another nightmare again, now that I’m in charge ofthe factory!”“Oh,” said Dennis, with a sad look on his face. “I’m seriously happy for you. But I guess you’rehere to take me back to the factory, since I wasn’t able to stop the paperwork.”“The funny thing about that,” said DC as he pulled out a piece of paper, “is that the contract was never stamped. First time it’s ever happened. It means the paper’s worthless. You can keep it if you want.”Dennis smiled. “What should I do with it?”“I would line the bottom of Charlie’s cage with it, but really that’s up to you.”“Thanks, DC.” Said Dennis. “Now, if it’s ok with you I’d like to get some sleep.”“Of course,” said DC, “it’s been a long night.”Dennis drifted off to sleep before he could say another word. That night he dreamt of gnomes,and socks, and beautiful colors, and just the slightesthint of peppermint.The next thing he knew, Dennis was back in Remmy’s dark office, feeling as tired as ever.“We had a deal Dennis. Why did you leave your spot on the factory line? It took us a long timeto fix the mess you made. We had workers with buckets on their heads and dream mixeverywhere,” said Remmy in his sinister voice.Dennis didn’t know what to say. His eyes were feeling very heavy.“And you, DC! You were supposed to keep an eye on him. How could you let this happen?”“I’m sorry, Remmy. I don’t know how it happened,” answered DC.Dennis couldn’t believe it. DC was in the room with him! And he sounded out of breath.“Well, you’re going to regret this Dennis, believe me. Leave it to a human to break the rules ...”Remmy lectured. As he continued, Dennis felt himself fading closer and closer to sleep. He tried his best to keep his eyes open and listen but it was getting harder and harder.DC leaned over and whispered in his ear.“Let yourself fall asleep.”“What?” Dennis whispered back.“It’s the only way. I have your dream mix here. If you fall asleep, he will forced to talk to youinside your dream. It’s the only way to even the playing field,” said DC.Dennis was too tired to argue. He laid down on the soft, bed floor and fell asleep withinseconds. DC popped open the cork off the dream mix and sprinkled some onto Dennis.Inside his dream, Dennis was standing in an open field. There was a dark blue sky and amountain in the background. A moment later Remmy appeared. Dennis could now see himperfectly. He was larger than the other gnomes, with eyes a bright green. His hat was black asnight.“How dare you fall asleep in my presence!

Wave after wave, and they all went straight forRemmy.“What are you doing?!” cried Remmy, “Get them away from me!”Remmy ran off with the wolves close behind. The shackles on Dennis disappeared, and hisdream started to fade. He woke up to DC shaking him.“You’ve got to get out of here. Now’s your chance. It looks like Remmy is stuck in a nightmare,”said DC.Dennis didn’t question it. He ran straight out of the room and down the hallway filled withpictures and offices. At the opposite end of the hallway he found the room he was looking for.He opened the door to the Transportation Room and found the enormous homemade sockwhose pair he had traveled through. It was hanging from a clothesline (luckily anything hung on a gnome’s clothesline is easy to reach). Dennis pulled down the sock and climbed inside.After a quick slide, Dennis found himself crawling out of the huge sock in his bedroom. He was relieved to finally be home, but couldn’t relax just yet. As fast as he could, Dennis ripped up the sock.Then, he took all the socks in his drawer, brought them outside, and tossed them into thegarbage can outside. When he got back into his room, he shut the door behind him and got into bed.Charlie was sound asleep in his cage. Dennis could hardly believe what had happened. Just ashe shut his eyes, trying to think of what he would tell his friends he next day, he felt a slight tug on his sheets.“Hi, Dennis,” said DC, as he climbed up onto the bed.“DC! You’re ok!” said Dennis.“Well, I just traveled through your father’s putrid sock, but other than that I’m better than ever,and it’s all thanks to you.”“What do you mean?” asked Dennis.“Remmy is gone. It seems you scared him off. See, Remmy might have created nightmares, buthe had never actually experienced one until you sent those wolves after him. He ran away fromthe factory, and he’s been replaced.”“Replaced?! By who?”“Well according to the Board of Directors, whoever has the most experience with dreams is next in line.”“And who is that?”“The Dream Carrier.”“Who is the Dream Carrier, anyway?” asked Dennis.“Well ... me. That’s what DC stands for.”“You mean you deliver all the dreams to everyone in the world?”“That’s right. And I’ll never have to deliver another nightmare again, now that I’m in charge ofthe factory!”“Oh,” said Dennis, with a sad look on his face. “I’m seriously happy for you. But I guess you’rehere to take me back to the factory, since I wasn’t able to stop the paperwork.”“The funny thing about that,” said DC as he pulled out a piece of paper, “is that the contract was never stamped. First time it’s ever happened. It means the paper’s worthless. You can keep it if you want.”Dennis smiled. “What should I do with it?”“I would line the bottom of Charlie’s cage with it, but really that’s up to you.”“Thanks, DC.” Said Dennis. “Now, if it’s ok with you I’d like to get some sleep.”“Of course,” said DC, “it’s been a long night.”Dennis drifted off to sleep before he could say another word.
