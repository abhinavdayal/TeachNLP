Long ago, there was a rock floating through space, searching for where she belonged. She would visit many planets and travel to the farthest reaches of the universe, but would she find what she was looking for? The Stellar One is a tale of self-esteem and self-discovery.if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0')};  by Daniel ErricoWhen the universe was young the sky was filled with planets, and stars, and stardust, and many many rocks. One of these rocks was a bit more special than the rest.  She was unlike any that came before her. She was a kind and happy rock, who always floated near a big blue planet. Sometimes when the light hit her surface, she would glow a brilliant green.  At times like those, she almost didn't look like a rock at all. As the sky moved from day to day, and week to week, the rock would see planets far off in the distance. She would wonder what it would be like to go to them. Week after week and month after month she would wonder. Until one day she decided to go find out. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-box-4-0')};The rock had never gone anywhere before and wasn't sure how to go about it. She started to rock back and forth.Then she started to spin. Soon enough, she was flying through the sky. As she left, clouds swirled on the big blue planet. For it was sad to see her go, and when planets cry there is a rain storm. At first the rock was not good at moving. She would spin too far to the right or too far to the left. Slowly she learned how to travel whichever direction she liked, and she enjoyed exploring space. She saw a planet filled with water, with not a speck of land.Then found a planet all dried up, with beaches made of sand.She swore she met a planet who looked suspiciously like her.And then she saw a planet that was, well… she wasn’t sure. One planet she discovered, had grown forests made of green.Another one was very shy, not fond of being seen.She flew right by a planet, that was frozen icy cold.And then she saw a planet that was made of jewels and gold!She had started to notice that each planet seemed brighter than the last. They were all so different and all so pretty. It became hard for her to decide where to go next. If each planet she visited was more beautiful than the one before it, then how could she decide which way to go next, and how could she decide where to stay. So she continued traveling, afraid to miss a single planet. Eventually she came upon the big blue planet that she had once circled, but she found that is was not the same. It was shining in a way that it never had before. It was more blue than it had ever been, and certainly more beautiful. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')};This made her stop for a moment. “I do not know where I should go next” she said out loud. “Each direction is filled with wonderful planets. And I cannot stop, knowing that the next planet will be even more beautiful if I continue on. Even my big blue planet has grown more beautiful every day in my absence.”The big blue planet overheard this. “Can you not see why I am brighter?" it asked."You are the brightest planet I have ever seen," she said, "but I do not know why you glow brighter today than you did when I left you."“You have brightened me,” it said. “But I am just a rock” she replied. “You are no longer just a rock like the day you left me,” said the big blue planet. “You have grown bold and bright. Now you are a shooting star, and you are the reason that I shine.  And while you are worrying about which direction to go, all of the planets in space are hoping that you will come their way to brighten them.”And so the shooting star, who was no longer just a rock, finally understood. It did not matter where she went, the light was her own. So the rock sat there for a moment, by the bright blue planet and wondered.  "Should I keep traveling, or should I fly around the big blue planet and grow brighter with it each day.”She thought, until she knew exactly what to do. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-leader-1-0')};When the universe was young the sky was filled with planets, and stars, and stardust, and many many rocks. One of these rocks was a bit more special than the rest.  She was unlike any that came before her. She was a kind and happy rock, who always floated near a big blue planet. Sometimes when the light hit her surface, she would glow a brilliant green.  At times like those, she almost didn't look like a rock at all. As the sky moved from day to day, and week to week, the rock would see planets far off in the distance. She would wonder what it would be like to go to them.

Slowly she learned how to travel whichever direction she liked, and she enjoyed exploring space. She saw a planet filled with water, with not a speck of land.Then found a planet all dried up, with beaches made of sand.She swore she met a planet who looked suspiciously like her.And then she saw a planet that was, well… she wasn’t sure. One planet she discovered, had grown forests made of green.Another one was very shy, not fond of being seen.She flew right by a planet, that was frozen icy cold.And then she saw a planet that was made of jewels and gold!She had started to notice that each planet seemed brighter than the last. They were all so different and all so pretty. It became hard for her to decide where to go next. If each planet she visited was more beautiful than the one before it, then how could she decide which way to go next, and how could she decide where to stay. So she continued traveling, afraid to miss a single planet. Eventually she came upon the big blue planet that she had once circled, but she found that is was not the same. It was shining in a way that it never had before. It was more blue than it had ever been, and certainly more beautiful. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')};This made her stop for a moment. “I do not know where I should go next” she said out loud. “Each direction is filled with wonderful planets. And I cannot stop, knowing that the next planet will be even more beautiful if I continue on. Even my big blue planet has grown more beautiful every day in my absence.”The big blue planet overheard this. “Can you not see why I am brighter?" it asked."You are the brightest planet I have ever seen," she said, "but I do not know why you glow brighter today than you did when I left you."“You have brightened me,” it said. “But I am just a rock” she replied. “You are no longer just a rock like the day you left me,” said the big blue planet. “You have grown bold and bright. Now you are a shooting star, and you are the reason that I shine.  And while you are worrying about which direction to go, all of the planets in space are hoping that you will come their way to brighten them.”And so the shooting star, who was no longer just a rock, finally understood. It did not matter where she went, the light was her own. So the rock sat there for a moment, by the bright blue planet and wondered.  "Should I keep traveling, or should I fly around the big blue planet and grow brighter with it each day.”She thought, until she knew exactly what to do. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-leader-1-0')};Sometimes when the light hit her surface, she would glow a brilliant green.  At times like those, she almost didn't look like a rock at all. As the sky moved from day to day, and week to week, the rock would see planets far off in the distance. She would wonder what it would be like to go to them.

by Daniel ErricoI woke in the night to a noise from the kitchen,So off I set out on a fact-finding mission.Whatever it was, I did not have a clue.As I got closer I heard a loud chew.The fridge door was open with food on the ground.A tiny blue penguin was looking around!He looked through our food and he tossed it aside.He opened each can and shook out the inside.“Excuse me!” I said, but he seemed not to care.I shut the fridge door and he shot me a glare.“Jelly,” he said as he held up some bread,With smooth peanut butter, he must have just spread.I woke in the night to a noise from the

Raymond Mayweather and Huffemup Island by Daniel ErricoRaymond Mayweather tuned up his ship.He checked every, latch and he fixed every drip.It was time for his voyage to deep outer space.As always he hoped to find some unknown place.Raymond flew his ship up and out of the Earth’s atmosphere. He flew past Saturn’s rings and beyond the icy Pluto. After flying for a long time he came upon a small planet, and decided it was time to go exploring. Raymond Mayweather and Huffemup Island by Daniel ErricoRaymond Mayweather tuned up his ship.He checked every, latch and he fixed every drip.It was time for his voyage to deep outer space.As always he hoped to find some unknown place.Raymond flew his ship up and out of the Earth’s atmosphere.

One island was very colorful and the other was brown and dull.

Would you mind telling where I am, and what kind of creature you are?”“I am a Huffemup, you are on the Huffemup Island, and you’re blocking my sunlight.”“Terribly sorry,” said Raymond. “What are these trees I see all over your island?” he asked.“Those are the Figgy Melon trees. They grow all over our island, and nowhere else. We Huffemups love the taste of Figgy Melons.”“I see,” said Raymond, “And who lives on the other island here on your planet.”“The Durds live there,” said the Huffemup, “They don’t have any Figgy Melons, or any food at all really. The only plants that grow on their island are small green shrubs that are not good for eating. Instead they try hard to catch fish in the shallow water, but there are never many to go around.”“It seems like you have a lot of Figgy Melons,” said Raymond, “So many that you could offer some to the Durds.”“Impossible!” said the Huffemup. “Figgy Melons grow here and not there. The Durds do not deserve our melons! They are for us and nobody else! Now I am going to finish my nap, if you don’t mind, Maymond Fayweather.” Raymond tried to correct him, “Actually, my name is-“ but the Huffemup was already asleep.Raymond started to look around Huffemup Island. He saw that there were many, many Figgy Melon trees. He cracked one open and saw that they had very large seeds inside. Judging by the piles of seeds he saw on the beach, he concluded that the Huffemups spit them out with their large snouts.It was then that Raymond had an idea.“If the Huffemups won’t help the Durds then I will do it for them,” thought Raymond.He went into his spaceship and brought out his tools. He worked for hours and hours, and when he was finished he had built a boat out of Figgy Melon trees!The Huffemup woke up and saw what Raymond had done. “Are you trying to steal our Figgy Melons in a boat!?” yelled the Huffemup.“Of course not,” said Raymond, “A boat such as this could only fit a few Figgy Melons inside, surely not enough to make a difference for anyone. This boat is my gift to you so that you may get rid of all your pesky Figgy seeds. Why not take them on this boat and dump them onto Durds Island. Garbage does not belong on your fair Island, and it is much more suited for theirs. You can even fish in the deep water as you go, because surely you are meant to be better fishermen than the Durds as well.“Hmmm, this does makes sense,” said the Huffemup. Raymond walked along the beach and collected all the Figgy seeds he could find that had been spit out by the Huffemups. The Huffemup took this opportunity to take a well-deserved nap inside the boat. “I am a Huffemup, you are on the Huffemup Island, and you’re blocking my sunlight.”“Terribly sorry,” said Raymond. “What are these trees I see all over your island?” he asked.“Those are the Figgy Melon trees. They grow all over our island, and nowhere else.

The only plants that grow on their island are small green shrubs that are not good for eating. Instead they try hard to catch fish in the shallow water, but there are never many to go around.”“It seems like you have a lot of Figgy Melons,” said Raymond, “So many that you could offer some to the Durds.”“Impossible!” said the Huffemup. “Figgy Melons grow here and not there. The Durds do not deserve our melons! They are for us and nobody else! Now I am going to finish my nap, if you don’t mind, Maymond Fayweather.” Raymond tried to correct him, “Actually, my name is-“ but the Huffemup was already asleep.Raymond started to look around Huffemup Island. He saw that there were many, many Figgy Melon trees. He cracked one open and saw that they had very large seeds inside. Judging by the piles of seeds he saw on the beach, he concluded that the Huffemups spit them out with their large snouts.It was then that Raymond had an idea.“If the Huffemups won’t help the Durds then I will do it for them,” thought Raymond.He went into his spaceship and brought out his tools. He worked for hours and hours, and when he was finished he had built a boat out of Figgy Melon trees!The Huffemup woke up and saw what Raymond had done. “Are you trying to steal our Figgy Melons in a boat!?” yelled the Huffemup.“Of course not,” said Raymond, “A boat such as this could only fit a few Figgy Melons inside, surely not enough to make a difference for anyone. This boat is my gift to you so that you may get rid of all your pesky Figgy seeds. Why not take them on this boat and dump them onto Durds Island. Garbage does not belong on your fair Island, and it is much more suited for theirs. You can even fish in the deep water as you go, because surely you are meant to be better fishermen than the Durds as well.“Hmmm, this does makes sense,” said the Huffemup. Raymond walked along the beach and collected all the Figgy seeds he could find that had been spit out by the Huffemups. The Huffemup took this opportunity to take a well-deserved nap inside the boat. “Terribly sorry,” said Raymond. “What are these trees I see all over your island?” he asked.“Those are the Figgy Melon trees. They grow all over our island, and nowhere else.

The Huffemup took this opportunity to take a well-deserved nap inside the boat. Raymond started to look around Huffemup Island. He saw that there were many, many Figgy Melon trees. He cracked one open and saw that they had very large seeds inside. Judging by the piles of seeds he saw on the beach, he concluded that the Huffemups spit them out with their large snouts.It was then that Raymond had an idea.“If the Huffemups won’t help the Durds then I will do it for them,” thought Raymond.He went into his spaceship and brought out his tools. He worked for hours and hours, and when he was finished he had built a boat out of Figgy Melon trees!The Huffemup woke up and saw what Raymond had done. “Are you trying to steal our Figgy Melons in a boat!?” yelled the Huffemup.“Of course not,” said Raymond, “A boat such as this could only fit a few Figgy Melons inside, surely not enough to make a difference for anyone. This boat is my gift to you so that you may get rid of all your pesky Figgy seeds. Why not take them on this boat and dump them onto Durds Island.

When he arrived on the Durds shore he was greeted by a friendly Durd, about to travel back to his village from a long day of fishing.“Hello,” said the Durd, “Since you are a guest on Durds Island, may I offer you a fish.”Raymond set sail immediately, hoping that he had seen the last of that particular Huffemup.

From now on, the Huffemups will be dropping off Figgy seeds such as these on your island. Take these seeds and plant them in the ground, but do not tell them that you are planting the seeds. Instead act like you are unhappy. Make sure that the seeds get plenty of sunlight and water, and you will have all the Figgy Melons you can eat soon enough.

As always, he hoped to find some unknown place.Raymond’s ship hurtled into outer space.  He flew past all of the other planets he had visited. He took the Galactic highway to the very end. He flew further into space than he ever had before! Eventually, he came upon a small blue planet. As he got closer he realized that the entire planet was covered in ice. He set his ship down on a landing pad and was greeted by a small blue creature covered in fur.Raymond put his arctic snow suit on and hopped out of his ship.It was time for his voyage to deep outer space.

When they got inside he found that it was not any warmer than outside!The fuzzy creature was sitting around a table surrounded by more furry creatures. Raymond decided to call them ‘fruzzies’, in his space log. “Excuse me,” said Raymond, “But what is tilber? Each planet has a different name for things. Maybe I do know where some tilber is.”“Tilber, is the what we use to heat our planet. We burn the tilber and it keeps us warm. We ran out of all our tilber days ago. I sent for more, but no other planets have any for us. As Supreme Chancellor of this planet, it’s up to me to find more tilber.”The other fruzzies around the table started to throw out ideas to help.“Mr. Chancellor, sir,” said a stern-faced fruzzy, “As head of your military, I suggest we attack another planet and take their tilber!”“It is not their fault that we ran out of tilber,” said the Chancellor, “No.”“Mr. Chancellor, sir,” said a female fruzzy with long frizzy hair, “As head of your Chief Scientist, I say we build rockets and use them to push our planet closer to the sun. It might be a good idea to build some brakes too…”“Our planet is fine where it is,” said the Chancellor,” and rockets need tilber to run.”“Dad!” said a young fruzzy, “I think the best idea is to give everyone thermometers that say it is warmer than it really is. That way they’ll think that they are warmer.”It was then that Raymond spoke up.“Mr. Chancellor, sir. These are all interesting ideas. But, if you have any tilber at all, I can study it back on my ship. If there is none left anywhere, then maybe I can find something just as good. “The Chancellor agreed took Raymond behind the building to where the tilber used to be stored. The other fruzzies argued over which idea was best and the Chancellor’s son was winning.Behind the building, were three hollow mountains with no tops. Raymond was not used to such a cold welcome, and he needed to warm up.

The other fruzzies argued over which idea was best and the Chancellor’s son was winning.Behind the building, were three hollow mountains with no tops. The fuzzy creature was sitting around a table surrounded by more furry creatures. Raymond decided to call them ‘fruzzies’, in his space log. “Excuse me,” said Raymond, “But what is tilber? Each planet has a different name for things. Maybe I do know where some tilber is.”“Tilber, is the what we use to heat our planet. We burn the tilber and it keeps us warm. We ran out of all our tilber days ago. I sent for more, but no other planets have any for us. As Supreme Chancellor of this planet, it’s up to me to find more tilber.”The other fruzzies around the table started to throw out ideas to help.“Mr. Chancellor, sir,” said a stern-faced fruzzy, “As head of your military, I suggest we attack another planet and take their tilber!”“It is not their fault that we ran out of tilber,” said the Chancellor, “No.”“Mr. Chancellor, sir,” said a female fruzzy with long frizzy hair, “As head of your Chief Scientist, I say we build rockets and use them to push our planet closer to the sun. It might be a good idea to build some brakes too…”“Our planet is fine where it is,” said the Chancellor,” and rockets need tilber to run.”“Dad!” said a young fruzzy, “I think the best idea is to give everyone thermometers that say it is warmer than it really is.

It was a better plan than invading a planet, better than driving the planet into the sun, or giving out trick thermometers!After all the work was done, Raymond and the Chancellor called all the fruzzies and balders together.“Good creatures,” said Raymond, “we have solved the tilber problem”All of the fruzzies thought that their idea had been chosen to save the planet.“You’ve been storing your tilber inside space volcanoes. And as any good space traveler knows, all it takes to wake up a space volcano is some space pepper. And I never leave Earth without space pepper.”Raymond walked to the top of the volcano and sprinkled some space pepper inside.The space volcano grumbled and rumbled, and started to shake.  Raymond slid back down and watched. There was a loud, “AH CHOO,” and space lava started flowing down the mountain!The balders had dug a large moat around the planet which collected the lava and kept everyone safe. Almost immediately the planet began to warm. All of the fruzzies and balders cheered. The Chancellor’s son was even cooling off in the snow. After a celebration they carried Raymond on their shoulders back to his ship.“Thank You!” said the Chancellor. “Please come visit us again, soon.”Raymond waved goodbye and bid them farewell. Raymond Mayweather tuned up his ship.He checked every latch, and he fixed every drip.He hurried on home, where the temperature’s right,And he cranked up the heat for his long return flight.The Chancellor was confused but listened to Raymond’s plan.

On the Great Hill, Yolks climb all day and all night. Follow one Yolk as he gets passed by others who happen to be faster at climbing. When he finally meets a Yolk who climbs even slower, he finds that there is one thing he has forgotten. Do you think he'll make it to the top? The allegory of The Great Hill teaches perseverance and perspective. The Great Hillby Daniel ErricoBefore time was time, there was a Great Hill. And on the Great Hill there lived the Yolks.The Yolks spent their entire lives climbing the Great Hill, trying to reach the top.Some Yolks climbed fast.Some Yolks climbed slowly.One Yolk in particular was a very slow climber. He was different than the rest of the Yolks.When he climbed, all the other Yolks passed him. It was hard for him to watch them pass by.He felt like the worst climber in the world.Some Yolks made fun of him as they passed.Others didn’t.Some Yolks wanted to help him climb but he didn’t let them.It was hard for him to climb.

Sometimes it seemed like it was only raining on him. But it wasn’t.There were times when he felt like he wasn’t moving at all. But he was.Then one day he met another Yolk who climbed even slower than he did.He helped the slower Yolk climb.“Thank You,” said the slower Yolk.“You’re Welcome,” said the slow Yolk, “I can’t be of much help to anyone else since I climb so slowly.”“Slowly?” asked the slower Yolk.“Well yes. I watch other Yolks pass me all the time.” “I do not know if you are slow or fast, but I do know that you helped me, and that you are still climbing.”The slow Yolk said goodbye to the slower Yolk, and kept climbing. “Still climbing,” he thought to himself. “That is true.” And he smiled.So the Yolk kept climbing.

He was sleepier than he had ever been, from all the remarkably fast and fancy flying. The cricket slept all through the night until morning.When he woke up he was ready to go home and tell the ant about his trip.He hopped high in the air to start flying, but he couldn’t. Instead he fell right back into the snow. He hopped again, even higher this time, but his wings would not work. They had frozen solid during the cold night.  He tried to warm them up by rubbing them together but it was no use. The cricket had to hop all the way home.

There is so much out there to explore, from polar bears in the arctic to lemurs in the jungle! Hear this rhyming kids' song about wonderful, new, and sometimes odd, discoveries!by Daniel ErricoI went up to the arctic where I met a polar bear.You might think she’d be white, but she had purple yellow hair.I hopped on to a glacier and I rode it out to sea.Snow is great for sledding but it's much too cold for me.I like to go exploring places that I've never been.Take one step, and then another, that's how you begin.I made it to the jungle where a toucan said “Hello!”He made a hat from branches that he dropped to me below.High above in vines were where the lemurs liked to swing.They jumped around and laughed and that's when they began to sing:We like to go exploring places that we've never been.Take one swing, and then another, that's how we begin.I headed to the desert where the camel keeps his humps.He takes them off and puts them on, his fuzzy camel lumps.We stopped at an oasis, such a magic, mystique spot,But soon I had to leave for it was getting rather hot. I headed to the forest where the trees were made of gum,And if I come that way again, I’ll chew up every one.I hiked up to the mountains where the bobcat had her band. The goats and mountain lions joined the song that they had planned:We like to go exploring places we have never been.Take one step, and then another, that's how we begin.And if you don't believe the words I wrote inside this song,Take one step and then another, then go prove me wrong.I went up to the arctic where I met a polar bear.You might think she’d be white, but she had purple yellow hair.I hopped on to a glacier and I rode it out to

mountains where the bobcat had her band. The goats and mountain lions joined the song that they had planned:We like to go exploring places we have never been.Take one step, and then another, that's how we begin.And if you don't believe the words I wrote inside this song,Take one step and then another, then go prove me wrong.Snow is great for sledding but it's much too cold for me.I like to go exploring places that I've never been.Take one step, and then another, that's how you begin.I made it to the jungle where a toucan said “Hello!”He made a hat from branches that he dropped to me below.High above in vines were where the lemurs liked to swing.They jumped around and laughed and that's when they began to sing:We like to go exploring places that we've never been.Take

 Dennis didn’t feel like sleeping. He had gone to bed at the same time every night for as long ashe could remember. He was tired (not sleepy-tired, more like sick and tired) of going to bedwhen his parents told him to. So one night, when fall seemed over, but it wasn’t yet winter, hedecided he would stay up!What Dennis didn’t realize, is that staying awake at night is hard when your body needs tosleep. He tried everything he could think of to stop himself from falling asleep. He tried counting wolves (if counting sheep makes you sleepy, then counting wolves must surely do the opposite), but unfortunately it made him even more tired. He started to suspect that it was the counting, and not the choice of animal, that made people sleepy.He tried holding his eyelids open, but that was difficult and altogether odd-looking. He even tried doing math problems in his head to stay awake, but the only thing more boring than solving math problems is trying to think of math problems to solve.Dennis was just about ready to give up when he heard a faint squeak from his hamster Charlie.He went over to Charlie’s cage, but it was empty. Dennis followed the sounds of squeaking until he found Charlie on the floor, looking behind the dresser. Dennis noticed that something back there was throwing things at Charlie! Paperclips, balls of paper, and even some legos were flying in Charlie’s direction, as he squeaked.“What’s there, Charlie?” Dennis asked as he picked up the hamster and peered around behindthe dresser.What he saw made him wonder if he had actually fallen asleep and not realized it.“It’s a ... it’s a gnome!” he said. No bigger than Charlie (and no smaller), the gnome wore ayellow shirt, a tiny pair of green pants, and pointy hat. Had it not been for the pointy hat, Dennis might not have recognized it as a gnome. But, gnome or not, it was being quite rude to Charlie.“Why are you throwing things at my hamster, gnome?” asked Dennis.“Why do you keep a vicious beast as a pet, human?” asked the gnome.“Charlie is not vicious!” answered Dennis.“Yes he is, and he started it.”Charlie squeaked in protest.“More importantly, why are you in my room, gnome?” asked Dennis.“That is highly classified information, human.”“My name is not ‘human’, it’s Dennis.” he said angrily.“I already know your name. And for your information, gnomes have names too!”Dennis didn’t say anything for a moment, and neither did the gnome. It was an awkward silencefor everyone except Charlie who, as usual, had fallen asleep shortly after Dennis picked him up.“Well, what is your name then?” asked Dennis.What Dennis didn’t realize, is that staying awake at night is hard when your body needs tosleep.

It was an awkward silencefor everyone except Charlie who, as usual, had fallen asleep shortly after Dennis picked him up.“Well, what is your name then?” asked Dennis.“Why are you throwing things at my hamster, gnome?” asked Dennis.“Why do you keep a vicious beast as a pet, human?” asked the gnome.“Charlie is not vicious!” answered Dennis.“Yes he is, and he started it.”Charlie squeaked in protest.“More importantly, why are you in my room, gnome?” asked Dennis.“That is highly classified information, human.”“My name is not ‘human’, it’s Dennis.” he said angrily.“I already know your name.

It was an awkward silencefor everyone except Charlie who, as usual, had fallen asleep shortly after Dennis picked him up.“Well, what is your name then?” asked Dennis. “It’s DC. And, I suppose,” said DC begrudgingly, “I should thank you for saving me from thebeast,” said DC.Dennis was still having trouble thinking of the the furry little hamster who was snoring in ishands as a beast, but he still replied, “You’re welcome,” anyway.“You were supposed to be asleep hours ago,” said DC, “and now you’ve seen me. This is bad...this is very bad. I have no choice but to bring you back to the factory.”“What factory?” asked Dennis.“The dream factory,” answered DC.The gnome crawled up the dresser and opened up Dennis’ sock drawer. He rummaged throughuntil he found the sock he was looking for. “Oh, I lost the other sock to that pair,” said Dennisshyly.“I wouldn’t say ‘lost’,” replied DC as he climbed inside the sock and disappeared. Dennis wasastonished. He had watched DC crawl into the sock, and now he was gone! He picked up thesock and looked inside, but there was nothing in there. A moment later DC came crawling backout, tugging a large piece of cloth behind him.“You see,” said DC, “The only way to get to the dream factory is by sock. You go in one sockand come out the other. Since you are a human, you can’t fit in a regular sock, so I brought ourfreight sock with me.”As he spoke, DC pulled out a sock the size of a bed. The huge sock was made up of manysmaller socks sewn together. “Socks?! How can I go in one sock and come out of another?” Dennis asked.“It’s simple,” DC said, “every sock was created with an identical mate- another sock that it isnaturally connected to. Just like you have two feet that are separate, but are both connected to each other through you. Well, the socks we use to travel are connected through magic. All we have to do is get one sock (usually we take them from the washer or dryer) and then we can create a passage way to its partner sock.”Dennis was still confused. Confused in the way you are when a gnome tells you your socks aremagic.“That last part is not as simple- it’s handled by our Autosock Magical Recalibration Division, and the guys who work there are an odd bunch. Anyway, the result is that you go in one sock, and you will always come out the other. That way we can travel from the factory to your home with ease.”“But, that doesn’t tell me anything! Like why do you need to come here at all, and what is at this factory?” asked Dennis.“Ah,” said DC, holding open the enormous sock, “climb inside. You’re about to find out.”Dennis crawled inside the huge sock nervously. It was dark, but smelled much nicer than he had imagined it would (had it smelled anything like his father’s socks, he would have turned around immediately). Dennis didn’t get far before he started to slide. He slid for what seemed like a minute, going faster and faster until he flew out into a large room onto a huge pile of pillows. DC was already in the room beside the pillows, ready to greet him.“It’s DC. And, I suppose,” said DC begrudgingly, “I should thank you for saving me from thebeast,” said DC.Dennis was still having trouble thinking of the the furry little hamster who was snoring in ishands as a beast, but he still replied, “You’re welcome,” anyway.“You were supposed to be asleep hours ago,” said DC, “and now you’ve seen me.

DC was already in the room beside the pillows, ready to greet him. “Welcome to the Dream Factory. This is the Transportation Room. Those socks you seehanging up there are the socks we use for incoming and outgoing trips.”A group of gnomes, who were busy working around the room when Dennis flew in, had nowstopped what they were doing and crowded around.“It’s best if we get going,” said DC, as he led Dennis out of the Transportation Room and into alarge hallway.“This is the Executive Wing. All of the higher-ups have their offices on the other side of thesedoors,” said DC.“What are all of these paintings?” asked Dennis.“Those are paintings of some of Remmy’s favorite dreams, collected over thousands of years.Remmy is in charge of the factory and all the dreams in the entire world. That is who I’m takingyou to see.”“All the colors are so dark, doesn’t he like any nice dreams?” asked Dennis.DC paused for a moment and changed his tone.“Remmy doesn’t care much for those types of dreams. He is the inventor of nightmares.”“That’s horrible,” said Dennis, “You don’t have anything to do with nightmares, do you, DC?” “Welcome to the Dream Factory. This is the Transportation Room.

He is the inventor of nightmares.”“That’s horrible,” said Dennis, “You don’t have anything to do with nightmares, do you, DC?”  “Here we are,” DC quickly replied. They had arrived at the end of the large hall and werestanding at the entrance to Remmy’s office. It was the blackest shade of black that Dennis hadever seen. And above it was a sign that read:“All Ye Who Pass This Crest Shall Find Yourself in Waking Rest.” “All Ye Who Pass This Crest Shall Find Yourself in Waking Rest.”  “Should we knock?” asked Dennis. “There’s nothing to knock on,” answered DC, “Remmydoesn’t have a door. I must warn you. Once you walk through that entrance you will feel like you are asleep, but you are not. Do not let your guard down, because Remmy does not like humans, and he can be very devious.” Dennis nodded and followed DC into the darkness.The moment he cleared the opening, Dennis felt as though his eyes had shut. He was certainhe was standing on a bed, and his head felt heavy. He was getting more comfortable and moresleepy by the second. It felt as though a warm blanket had just been put over him (and noamount of wolf-counting or math problems could help him now).“Who have you brought with you, DC?” asked a soft but sinister voice.“This is Dennis. He was awake when I arrived at his home tonight, and he saved me.”“I see,” said Remmy. “What were you doing awake, Dennis?”Dennis was so tired that he could barely speak. “I ... didn’t want to. Don’t like ... sleeping.”“You don’t like sleeping?” said Remmy a little louder.This woke Dennis up a little bit, and his eyes opened slightly for just a moment. He could barely see what was in front of him, but he thought that he had seen a pair of green eyes.“Well,” continued Remmy in a soothing voice, “You should come work at the factory then. Timestands still while you are here, and you will never have to go to bed, ever again. Doesn’t thatsound perfect?”“Yes,” mumbled Dennis.“But Dennis—“ interjected DC, but he was cut off by Remmy.“Excellent,” said Remmy, “You will start immediately. Show him around, DC.”DC led Dennis back out of the room without him ever really seeing what Remmy looked like. Hecould still barely open his eyes when he stepped back into the hall. DC took him through manyother hallways. By the time Dennis had finally snapped out of it, he was standing on a factoryline in front of a conveyor belt.“Where am I?” he asked.“I told you not to trust him, but you didn’t listen!” said DC. “You’re on the factory line becauseyou told Remmy you’d work here!”“Oh no,” thought Dennis. “What am I going to do?” he asked.“There’s nothing you can do. You just accepted his job offer. Once the paperwork goes through,you will be bound to the factory forever. Your job is on the dream factory line, bottling dreams.I’m sorry.” said DC, and Dennis could tell that he meant it.“I can’t stay here. I’ve got to stop that paperwork!” cried Dennis.“Who’s this, DC?” asked a gnome with a black beard.“This is Dennis,” he answered, “Remmy just assigned him here. He’s going to be working foryou.”“Ah, a new employee! I’m not used to such a large worker, but the bigger they are the longerthey can work, I always say! My name is Foreman, and I’m your boss. Come on, I’ll show youhow it works, kid.” Foreman started to lead Dennis away.“I’ll do what I can to get you out of here ... til then play along,” DC whispered and then ran off.“Your job is to be a dream-mixer. You mix a dream, pour it in a bottle, then set it on the conveyor belt. It’s as simple as that.”“How do you mix a dream?”“Excellent question! Now listen up because I will only tell you once,” said Foreman. “There arethree main ingredients to a dream mix. Once it gets delivered to a person it mixes with their own memories and thoughts to make a dream. All they need to do is take one sniff of it. It’s really quite extraordinary. Over here we have the feelings station. Feelings are the first ingredient.”Foreman showed Dennis dozens of buckets with powder inside them, next to a large machinethat was smashing cubes into a fine powder.“That machine there is what we like to call the Dream Crusher. The gnomes from the FeelingsLaboratory bring us blocks of pure feelings, and we crush them down into a powder, becauseone dash is more than enough for a dream. We have happiness, sadness, love, boredom, oranything else out there. If you can feel it, you can dream it! Unfortunately, ever since Remmy’sbeen in charge we’ve had to put fear into dreams sometimes too. Anyway, you sprinkle a littlepowder into the bottle and you’re ready for the next step. I hope you’re following.”Dennis nodded, as Foreman showed him a stand with different colored liquids in it.“Good. The next ingredient is color. You pick any colors you want. Light colors, dark colors,weird colors, dull colors, or my favorite- colors that really don’t go together. Then you scoopthem into the bottle with this ladle. The person who gets that mix will see those colors in theirdream. Got it?”Dennis nodded again.“Good, now you’re ready for the last ingredient: peppermint.”“Peppermint?” asked Dennis.“Yep, peppermint. You take a little peppermint from this container here, and you’re ready to cork the bottle and put it on the belt. Good luck. Now I’ve gotta go check on some other employees.”Dennis was nodding in a daze.“Gidget, for the last time that is way too much peppermint!” yelled Foreman as he walked awayto scold a confused-looking gnome.Dennis was starting to wish that he had gone to sleep at his bedtime. Anything would be betterthan being forced by gnomes to work on a factory line.“I’ve got to find a way out of this place,” thought Dennis. “What I need is a diversion. I need tosomething to distract Foreman!”It was hard for him to think with the Dream Crusher making so much noise.“I’ve got it!” he said.That was the moment when Dennis decided he was going to make his very first, and hopefullyvery last, dream mix.He looked through all the buckets of feelings and found the perfect one. It was labeled:“confusion”.He sprinkled a large amount of the confusion powder into a bottle. Next he poured his favoritecolors inside: blue, green, and white. He was about to put the cork in until he remembered thelast ingredient.“I almost forgot the peppermint!” he said.A dash of peppermint later, and he had made a dream mix, corked and ready to be put on theconveyor belt. But that’s not where he put it. Instead, Dennis snuck over to the Dream Crusher,tossed the bottle inside, and went back over to the conveyor belt. The moment he cleared the opening, Dennis felt as though his eyes had shut. He was certainhe was standing on a bed, and his head felt heavy. He was getting more comfortable and moresleepy by the second.

I need tosomething to distract Foreman!”It was hard for him to think with the Dream Crusher making so much noise.“I’ve got it!” he said.That was the moment when Dennis decided he was going to make his very first, and hopefullyvery last, dream mix.He looked through all the buckets of feelings and found the perfect one. It was labeled:“confusion”.He sprinkled a large amount of the confusion powder into a bottle. Next he poured his favoritecolors inside: blue, green, and white. He was about to put the cork in until he remembered thelast ingredient.“I almost forgot the peppermint!” he said.A dash of peppermint later, and he had made a dream mix, corked and ready to be put on theconveyor belt. But that’s not where he put it. Instead, Dennis snuck over to the Dream Crusher,tossed the bottle inside, and went back over to the conveyor belt. “Who have you brought with you, DC?” asked a soft but sinister voice.“This is Dennis. He was awake when I arrived at his home tonight, and he saved me.”“I see,” said Remmy. “What were you doing awake, Dennis?”Dennis was so tired that he could barely speak. “I ... didn’t want to. Don’t like ... sleeping.”“You don’t like sleeping?” said Remmy a little louder.This woke Dennis up a little bit, and his eyes opened slightly for just a moment. He could barely see what was in front of him, but he thought that he had seen a pair of green eyes.“Well,” continued Remmy in a soothing voice, “You should come work at the factory then. Timestands still while you are here, and you will never have to go to bed, ever again. Doesn’t thatsound perfect?”“Yes,” mumbled Dennis.“But Dennis—“ interjected DC, but he was cut off by Remmy.“Excellent,” said Remmy, “You will start immediately. Show him around, DC.”DC led Dennis back out of the room without him ever really seeing what Remmy looked like. Hecould still barely open his eyes when he stepped back into the hall. DC took him through manyother hallways. By the time Dennis had finally snapped out of it, he was standing on a factoryline in front of a conveyor belt.“Where am I?” he asked.“I told you not to trust him, but you didn’t listen!” said DC. “You’re on the factory line becauseyou told Remmy you’d work here!”“Oh no,” thought Dennis. “What am I going to do?” he asked.“There’s nothing you can do. You just accepted his job offer. Once the paperwork goes through,you will be bound to the factory forever. Your job is on the dream factory line, bottling dreams.I’m sorry.” said DC, and Dennis could tell that he meant it.“I can’t stay here. I’ve got to stop that paperwork!” cried Dennis.“Who’s this, DC?” asked a gnome with a black beard.“This is Dennis,” he answered, “Remmy just assigned him here. He’s going to be working foryou.”“Ah, a new employee! I’m not used to such a large worker, but the bigger they are the longerthey can work, I always say! My name is Foreman, and I’m your boss. Come on, I’ll show youhow it works, kid.” Foreman started to lead Dennis away.“I’ll do what I can to get you out of here ... til then play along,” DC whispered and then ran off.“Your job is to be a dream-mixer. You mix a dream, pour it in a bottle, then set it on the conveyor belt. It’s as simple as that.”“How do you mix a dream?”“Excellent question! Now listen up because I will only tell you once,” said Foreman. “There arethree main ingredients to a dream mix. Once it gets delivered to a person it mixes with their own memories and thoughts to make a dream. All they need to do is take one sniff of it. It’s really quite extraordinary. Over here we have the feelings station. Feelings are the first ingredient.”Foreman showed Dennis dozens of buckets with powder inside them, next to a large machinethat was smashing cubes into a fine powder.“That machine there is what we like to call the Dream Crusher. The gnomes from the FeelingsLaboratory bring us blocks of pure feelings, and we crush them down into a powder, becauseone dash is more than enough for a dream. We have happiness, sadness, love, boredom, oranything else out there. If you can feel it, you can dream it! Unfortunately, ever since Remmy’sbeen in charge we’ve had to put fear into dreams sometimes too. Anyway, you sprinkle a littlepowder into the bottle and you’re ready for the next step. I hope you’re following.”Dennis nodded, as Foreman showed him a stand with different colored liquids in it.“Good. The next ingredient is color. You pick any colors you want. Light colors, dark colors,weird colors, dull colors, or my favorite- colors that really don’t go together. Then you scoopthem into the bottle with this ladle. The person who gets that mix will see those colors in theirdream. Got it?”Dennis nodded again.“Good, now you’re ready for the last ingredient: peppermint.”“Peppermint?” asked Dennis.“Yep, peppermint. You take a little peppermint from this container here, and you’re ready to cork the bottle and put it on the belt. Good luck. Now I’ve gotta go check on some other employees.”Dennis was nodding in a daze.“Gidget, for the last time that is way too much peppermint!” yelled Foreman as he walked awayto scold a confused-looking gnome.Dennis was starting to wish that he had gone to sleep at his bedtime.

But that’s not where he put it. Instead, Dennis snuck over to the Dream Crusher,tossed the bottle inside, and went back over to the conveyor belt.  A few seconds later the Dream Crusher came crashing down. When the bottle broke, the dream mix was released and filled the entire room. Dennis was the only one holding his breath.Instantly, all of the gnomes stopped working. They were much too confused to get anythingdone.Some of them bumped into each other, but most of them just walked around in circles.Foreman had stopped yelling at the gnomes. He looked at the peppermint for a few secondsand then, without a word, started eating it.Dennis took the opportunity to hop onto the conveyor belt. It carried him out of the room, into a dark tunnel. He didn’t know where it would lead him, but he couldn’t hold his breath any longer, and had to get out of there (the only other time he had ever held his breath that long was when his father took his shoes off in the car).The tunnel stretched on until the conveyor belt came to an end, dropping him into a huge vat in a large, bright room. He was surrounded by dream mix bottles. When he heard some gnomescoming, Dennis climbed out and hid behind a pile of bags. The sign above the door read,“PACKING ROOM.” The gnomes were singing a song:“Rest your head and close your eyes, meet the sun at morning rise,If a dream is calm and deep, let it find you sound asleep”From behind the bags, Dennis watched the gnomes work. They grabbed bottles from the vatone by one and put them inside of bags, just like the ones he was hiding behind.“The carrier is taking the next batch out soon,” said a female gnome.“I’ll never understand how one gnome can deliver so many dreams, every night!” said a secondgnome.Just then a gnome driving a small car entered the room. The car was towing a bed behind it.The other gnomes loaded bag after bag onto the bed.“Tell the carrier we say hi,” they said to the driver as he started driving away.Dennis saw his chance to get out of the room. He hurried alongside the car, still crouchingbehind the rows of bags. Just before the car exited the room, he hopped on the bed and hidamong the bags. He sunk between two bags and sighed a deep sigh when he realized thatnone of the gnomes had seen him.He couldn’t see where they were headed but he heard the driver whistling the tune that thepacking gnomes were singing. Every once in a while he could hear the driver say hello to agnome as they drove by. After a few minutes, Dennis peaked through a small opening betweenthe bags. He looked at the words above the doors that they passed.The doors he saw said, in order: GNOME RESOURCES, SOCK REPAIR, FEELINGSLABORATORY, CONFERENCE ROOM D, and PAPERWORK APPROVAL.“Paperwork Approval,” thought Dennis, “That’s the one!”After a quick glance around to make sure the coast was clear, Dennis safely jumped off theback of the slowly-moving bed. He ran to the door of the Paperwork Approval Room, and snuckinside as quickly as he could.The room was small, and there was little light. Dennis saw another conveyor belt, but this onewas carrying papers, not bottles. The belt brought the papers in from a hole in the wall on oneside of the room, and took them out through another on the opposite side of the room. Therewas only one gnome inside, and he sat at the conveyor belt, stamping each paper as it passed.“Hello,” said Dennis.The gnome did not say a word. He was the first gnome Dennis had seen that was not wearing a pointy hat. This gnome was a good deal older than the others and wore a vest, tie, and argyle socks. As he continued to stamp, the gnome pointed to a sign on the wall that read:“NO VISITORS”. Some of them bumped into each other, but most of them just walked around in circles.Foreman had stopped yelling at the gnomes.

Therewas only one gnome inside, and he sat at the conveyor belt, stamping each paper as it passed.“Hello,” said Dennis.The gnome did not say a word. He was the first gnome Dennis had seen that was not wearing a pointy hat. This gnome was a good deal older than the others and wore a vest, tie, and argyle socks. As he continued to stamp, the gnome pointed to a sign on the wall that read:“NO VISITORS”. He couldn’t see where they were headed but he heard the driver whistling the tune that thepacking gnomes were singing. Every once in a while he could hear the driver say hello to agnome as they drove by. After a few minutes, Dennis peaked through a small opening betweenthe bags. He looked at the words above the doors that they passed.The doors he saw said, in order: GNOME RESOURCES, SOCK REPAIR, FEELINGSLABORATORY, CONFERENCE ROOM D, and PAPERWORK APPROVAL.“Paperwork Approval,” thought Dennis, “That’s the one!”After a quick glance around to make sure the coast was clear, Dennis safely jumped off theback of the slowly-moving bed. He ran to the door of the Paperwork Approval Room, and snuckinside as quickly as he could.The room was small, and there was little light.

As he continued to stamp, the gnome pointed to a sign on the wall that read:“NO VISITORS”. “NO VISITORS”.  “Please, sir,” pleaded Dennis, “I need to take a look at those papers. My name is Dennis. If youdon’t mind me asking, who are you?”The gnome continued to stamp as he spoke.“I am the Stamper, and you are distracting me. I have paperwork to stamp and I cannot miss asingle one. I have just enough ink to stamp every single paper for the day, not a drop more andnot a drop less. You cannot look at these papers. No one can. Now stop bothering me before Iyou make me miss.”“Well ... what kind of papers are they?” asked Dennis.“All of the papers from all of the departments in the factory are sent here. Could be gnomecomplaint forms, nap requests, employee contracts- they all come here,” said the Stamper ashe stamped.“Employee contracts! You have to let me look,” said Dennis.“No one may look!” yelled the Stamper. “I don’t even look at them,” he said under his breath, allthe while continuing to stamp.“You don’t look? But, you’re approving them. How can you do that?”“My job is extremely important,” he said, looking quite angry, “all these papers need approving,and without me they would not get approved.”“If you approve everything, then your approvals lose all meaning. You might as well have astamping machine approve them,” said Dennis.“A stamping machine?!” yelled the Stamper as he slammed his stamp down hard onto a paper,”A stamping machine cannot approve papers!”“You’re not even reading them,” answered Dennis, “don’t you think it’s irresponsible? Don’t youthink it’s silly? Don’t you think it’s ... wrong?”The Stamper froze for a few moments, then shook his head and continued stamping again.The door burst open and a dozen gnomes with uniforms came rushing in.They grabbed Dennis and picked him up, carrying him off.“We’ve found you!” said the head gnome. “You’re going to see Remmy.”Dennis shouted and struggled but it was no use.The Stamper had not looked up. As the guards carried Dennis through the doorway, theStamper stamped his last paper of the day, and put his stamp down. Right as the door shut, asingle drop of ink fell from his stamp.The next thing he knew, Dennis was back in Remmy’s dark office, feeling as tired as ever.“We had a deal Dennis. Why did you leave your spot on the factory line? It took us a long timeto fix the mess you made. We had workers with buckets on their heads and dream mixeverywhere,” said Remmy in his sinister voice.Dennis didn’t know what to say. His eyes were feeling very heavy.“And you, DC! You were supposed to keep an eye on him. How could you let this happen?”“I’m sorry, Remmy. I don’t know how it happened,” answered DC.Dennis couldn’t believe it. DC was in the room with him! And he sounded out of breath.“Well, you’re going to regret this Dennis, believe me. Leave it to a human to break the rules ...”Remmy lectured. As he continued, Dennis felt himself fading closer and closer to sleep. He tried his best to keep his eyes open and listen but it was getting harder and harder.DC leaned over and whispered in his ear.“Let yourself fall asleep.”“What?” Dennis whispered back.“It’s the only way. I have your dream mix here. If you fall asleep, he will forced to talk to youinside your dream. It’s the only way to even the playing field,” said DC.Dennis was too tired to argue. He laid down on the soft, bed floor and fell asleep withinseconds. DC popped open the cork off the dream mix and sprinkled some onto Dennis.Inside his dream, Dennis was standing in an open field. There was a dark blue sky and amountain in the background. A moment later Remmy appeared. Dennis could now see himperfectly. He was larger than the other gnomes, with eyes a bright green. His hat was black asnight.“How dare you fall asleep in my presence! Do you really think that you can battle me in a dream.I am Remmy, master of all dreams and creator of nightmares!” yelled Remmy.“I just want to go home,” shouted Dennis, “I don’t want to battle anyone.”“Well, I’m afraid that’s not going to happen. I decide where you go, and you are not leaving.”Shackles appeared out of nowhere and locked around Dennis’ arms and legs.“You see, you will never escape. I can do whatever I want here, all I have to do is imagine it. Ican even be bigger if I want!”Remmy nearly tripled in size right before Dennis’ eyes.“What can you do?!” laughed Remmy.Dennis had to think fast. How could he possibly beat someone as powerful as Remmy. That’swhen he remembered what DC had said, that being in his dream would level the playing field.That must mean that he can imagine things up too!“Well ...” said Dennis. “I can count wolves.”A wolf appeared next to Dennis, growling at Remmy.“Wolves?” asked Remmy with a bit of crack in his voice.“Yes, wolves,” answered DennisRemmy took a step back.“And I can count very high...”Wolves started appearing by the hundreds. Wave after wave, and they all went straight forRemmy.“What are you doing?!” cried Remmy, “Get them away from me!”Remmy ran off with the wolves close behind. The shackles on Dennis disappeared, and hisdream started to fade. He woke up to DC shaking him.“You’ve got to get out of here. Now’s your chance. It looks like Remmy is stuck in a nightmare,”said DC.Dennis didn’t question it. He ran straight out of the room and down the hallway filled withpictures and offices. At the opposite end of the hallway he found the room he was looking for.He opened the door to the Transportation Room and found the enormous homemade sockwhose pair he had traveled through. It was hanging from a clothesline (luckily anything hung on a gnome’s clothesline is easy to reach). Dennis pulled down the sock and climbed inside.After a quick slide, Dennis found himself crawling out of the huge sock in his bedroom. He was relieved to finally be home, but couldn’t relax just yet. As fast as he could, Dennis ripped up the sock.Then, he took all the socks in his drawer, brought them outside, and tossed them into thegarbage can outside. When he got back into his room, he shut the door behind him and got into bed.Charlie was sound asleep in his cage. Dennis could hardly believe what had happened. Just ashe shut his eyes, trying to think of what he would tell his friends he next day, he felt a slight tug on his sheets.“Hi, Dennis,” said DC, as he climbed up onto the bed.“DC! You’re ok!” said Dennis.“Well, I just traveled through your father’s putrid sock, but other than that I’m better than ever,and it’s all thanks to you.”“What do you mean?” asked Dennis.“Remmy is gone. It seems you scared him off. See, Remmy might have created nightmares, buthe had never actually experienced one until you sent those wolves after him. He ran away fromthe factory, and he’s been replaced.”“Replaced?! By who?”“Well according to the Board of Directors, whoever has the most experience with dreams is next in line.”“And who is that?”“The Dream Carrier.”“Who is the Dream Carrier, anyway?” asked Dennis.“Well ... me. That’s what DC stands for.”“You mean you deliver all the dreams to everyone in the world?”“That’s right. And I’ll never have to deliver another nightmare again, now that I’m in charge ofthe factory!”“Oh,” said Dennis, with a sad look on his face. “I’m seriously happy for you. But I guess you’rehere to take me back to the factory, since I wasn’t able to stop the paperwork.”“The funny thing about that,” said DC as he pulled out a piece of paper, “is that the contract was never stamped. First time it’s ever happened. It means the paper’s worthless. You can keep it if you want.”Dennis smiled. “What should I do with it?”“I would line the bottom of Charlie’s cage with it, but really that’s up to you.”“Thanks, DC.” Said Dennis. “Now, if it’s ok with you I’d like to get some sleep.”“Of course,” said DC, “it’s been a long night.”Dennis drifted off to sleep before he could say another word. That night he dreamt of gnomes,and socks, and beautiful colors, and just the slightesthint of peppermint.“I am the Stamper, and you are distracting me. I have paperwork to stamp and I cannot miss asingle one. I have just enough ink to stamp every single paper for the day, not a drop more andnot a drop less. You cannot look at these papers.

Why did you leave your spot on the factory line? It took us a long timeto fix the mess you made. We had workers with buckets on their heads and dream mixeverywhere,” said Remmy in his sinister voice.Dennis didn’t know what to say. His eyes were feeling very heavy.“And you, DC! You were supposed to keep an eye on him. How could you let this happen?”“I’m sorry, Remmy. I don’t know how it happened,” answered DC.Dennis couldn’t believe it. DC was in the room with him! And he sounded out of breath.“Well, you’re going to regret this Dennis, believe me. Leave it to a human to break the rules ...”Remmy lectured. As he continued, Dennis felt himself fading closer and closer to sleep. He tried his best to keep his eyes open and listen but it was getting harder and harder.DC leaned over and whispered in his ear.“Let yourself fall asleep.”“What?” Dennis whispered back.“It’s the only way. I have your dream mix here. If you fall asleep, he will forced to talk to youinside your dream. It’s the only way to even the playing field,” said DC.Dennis was too tired to argue. He laid down on the soft, bed floor and fell asleep withinseconds. DC popped open the cork off the dream mix and sprinkled some onto Dennis.Inside his dream, Dennis was standing in an open field. There was a dark blue sky and amountain in the background. A moment later Remmy appeared. Dennis could now see himperfectly. He was larger than the other gnomes, with eyes a bright green. His hat was black asnight.“How dare you fall asleep in my presence! Do you really think that you can battle me in a dream.I am Remmy, master of all dreams and creator of nightmares!” yelled Remmy.“I just want to go home,” shouted Dennis, “I don’t want to battle anyone.”“Well, I’m afraid that’s not going to happen. I decide where you go, and you are not leaving.”Shackles appeared out of nowhere and locked around Dennis’ arms and legs.“You see, you will never escape. I can do whatever I want here, all I have to do is imagine it. Ican even be bigger if I want!”Remmy nearly tripled in size right before Dennis’ eyes.“What can you do?!” laughed Remmy.Dennis had to think fast. How could he possibly beat someone as powerful as Remmy. That’swhen he remembered what DC had said, that being in his dream would level the playing field.That must mean that he can imagine things up too!“Well ...” said Dennis. “I can count wolves.”A wolf appeared next to Dennis, growling at Remmy.“Wolves?” asked Remmy with a bit of crack in his voice.“Yes, wolves,” answered DennisRemmy took a step back.“And I can count very high...”Wolves started appearing by the hundreds. Wave after wave, and they all went straight forRemmy.“What are you doing?!” cried Remmy, “Get them away from me!”Remmy ran off with the wolves close behind. The shackles on Dennis disappeared, and hisdream started to fade. He woke up to DC shaking him.“You’ve got to get out of here. Now’s your chance. It looks like Remmy is stuck in a nightmare,”said DC.Dennis didn’t question it. He ran straight out of the room and down the hallway filled withpictures and offices. At the opposite end of the hallway he found the room he was looking for.He opened the door to the Transportation Room and found the enormous homemade sockwhose pair he had traveled through. It was hanging from a clothesline (luckily anything hung on a gnome’s clothesline is easy to reach). Dennis pulled down the sock and climbed inside.After a quick slide, Dennis found himself crawling out of the huge sock in his bedroom. He was relieved to finally be home, but couldn’t relax just yet. As fast as he could, Dennis ripped up the sock.Then, he took all the socks in his drawer, brought them outside, and tossed them into thegarbage can outside. When he got back into his room, he shut the door behind him and got into bed.Charlie was sound asleep in his cage. Dennis could hardly believe what had happened. Just ashe shut his eyes, trying to think of what he would tell his friends he next day, he felt a slight tug on his sheets.“Hi, Dennis,” said DC, as he climbed up onto the bed.“DC! You’re ok!” said Dennis.“Well, I just traveled through your father’s putrid sock, but other than that I’m better than ever,and it’s all thanks to you.”“What do you mean?” asked Dennis.“Remmy is gone. It seems you scared him off. See, Remmy might have created nightmares, buthe had never actually experienced one until you sent those wolves after him. He ran away fromthe factory, and he’s been replaced.”“Replaced?! By who?”“Well according to the Board of Directors, whoever has the most experience with dreams is next in line.”“And who is that?”“The Dream Carrier.”“Who is the Dream Carrier, anyway?” asked Dennis.“Well ... me. That’s what DC stands for.”“You mean you deliver all the dreams to everyone in the world?”“That’s right. And I’ll never have to deliver another nightmare again, now that I’m in charge ofthe factory!”“Oh,” said Dennis, with a sad look on his face. “I’m seriously happy for you. But I guess you’rehere to take me back to the factory, since I wasn’t able to stop the paperwork.”“The funny thing about that,” said DC as he pulled out a piece of paper, “is that the contract was never stamped. First time it’s ever happened. It means the paper’s worthless. You can keep it if you want.”Dennis smiled. “What should I do with it?”“I would line the bottom of Charlie’s cage with it, but really that’s up to you.”“Thanks, DC.” Said Dennis. “Now, if it’s ok with you I’d like to get some sleep.”“Of course,” said DC, “it’s been a long night.”Dennis drifted off to sleep before he could say another word.

Dennis pulled down the sock and climbed inside.After a quick slide, Dennis found himself crawling out of the huge sock in his bedroom. He was relieved to finally be home, but couldn’t relax just yet. As fast as he could, Dennis ripped up the sock.Then, he took all the socks in his drawer, brought them outside, and tossed them into thegarbage can outside. When he got back into his room, he shut the door behind him and got into bed.Charlie was sound asleep in his cage. Dennis could hardly believe what had happened. Just ashe shut his eyes, trying to think of what he would tell his friends he next day, he felt a slight tug on his sheets.“Hi, Dennis,” said DC, as he climbed up onto the bed.“DC! You’re ok!” said Dennis.“Well, I just traveled through your father’s putrid sock, but other than that I’m better than ever,and it’s all thanks to you.”“What do you mean?” asked Dennis.“Remmy is gone. It seems you scared him off. See, Remmy might have created nightmares, buthe had never actually experienced one until you sent those wolves after him. He ran away fromthe factory, and he’s been replaced.”“Replaced?! By who?”“Well according to the Board of Directors, whoever has the most experience with dreams is next in line.”“And who is that?”“The Dream Carrier.”“Who is the Dream Carrier, anyway?” asked Dennis.“Well ... me. That’s what DC stands for.”“You mean you deliver all the dreams to everyone in the world?”“That’s right. And I’ll never have to deliver another nightmare again, now that I’m in charge ofthe factory!”“Oh,” said Dennis, with a sad look on his face. “I’m seriously happy for you. But I guess you’rehere to take me back to the factory, since I wasn’t able to stop the paperwork.”“The funny thing about that,” said DC as he pulled out a piece of paper, “is that the contract was never stamped. First time it’s ever happened. It means the paper’s worthless. You can keep it if you want.”Dennis smiled. “What should I do with it?”“I would line the bottom of Charlie’s cage with it, but really that’s up to you.”“Thanks, DC.” Said Dennis. “Now, if it’s ok with you I’d like to get some sleep.”“Of course,” said DC, “it’s been a long night.”Dennis drifted off to sleep before he could say another word. That night he dreamt of gnomes,and socks, and beautiful colors, and just the slightesthint of peppermint.Wolves started appearing by the hundreds. Wave after wave, and they all went straight forRemmy.“What are you doing?!” cried Remmy, “Get them away from me!”Remmy ran off with the wolves close behind. The shackles on Dennis disappeared, and hisdream started to fade. He woke up to DC shaking him.“You’ve got to get out of here. Now’s your chance. It looks like Remmy is stuck in a nightmare,”said DC.Dennis didn’t question it. He ran straight out of the room and down the hallway filled withpictures and offices.

Through an asteroid field and beyond a large star field, Raymond found a small blue planet. He lowered his ship to find a place to land, but didn’t have much luck. Almost every inch of the planet was covered with water!if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-box-4-0')};There was a river of rocks flowing nearby. Raymond couldn’t land on the rocks or his ship would be tossed and turned. Instead, he pushed a big red button, and his spaceship turned into a space-submarine (it was by far, his favorite button to push!). Once the submarine was underwater, he turned on the lights so that he wouldn’t miss seeing any of the planet’s underwater creatures. He checked every latch and he fixed every drip.He set a new course, for an unchartered place.It was time for a voyage to deep outer space.Raymond flew his ship straight out of the galaxy.

Raymond parked his space-submarine outside the sea castle, put on his underwater suit, and swam inside. Raymond entered a great hall which was beautiful, but empty, except for a large fish sitting on a throne. “Huzzah, Huzzay, who comes my way?” asked the Fish King.“It is I, Raymond Mayweather, space traveler extraordinaire and friend to all who swim in the sea. Might I ask, where are all the other sea creatures hiding?” “They’re not hiding,” answered the Fish King. “I ate them all up, and now I am hungry again. What kind of delicious fish are you?” Hours later, he came upon a sea castle with many doors (when it comes to underwater castles, even windows can be used as doors since you can swim right in).

What kind of delicious fish are you?” The Fish King liked his lips and eyed Raymond up for a snack. Raymond smiled and slowly backed up towards the nearest door.“I’m a human,” said Raymond, as he turned to swim away. “Quite poisonous for Fish Kings to eat!” he shouted as he left the sea castle.Raymond hopped into his space-submarine and tried to drive away as fast as he could in the opposite direction, but his controls weren’t working. Suddenly, he was pulled out of his ship by a whirlpool and spun around in the water. Soon, he and his sub were sucked in completely! The whirlpool took them in and spit them out through a fountain of water on the other side of the planet. He fell onto a patch of grass underneath a large tree, and his ship surfaced nearby.The Fish King liked his lips and eyed Raymond up for a snack.

He fell onto a patch of grass underneath a large tree, and his ship surfaced nearby.“I’m a human,” said Raymond, as he turned to swim away. “Quite poisonous for Fish Kings to eat!” he shouted as he left the sea castle.Raymond hopped into his space-submarine and tried to drive away as fast as he could in the opposite direction, but his controls weren’t working.

He fell onto a patch of grass underneath a large tree, and his ship surfaced nearby.“Finally, land!” thought Raymond. He got into his ship and pushed the red button one more time to turn it back into a space ship. Raymond got ready to fly his off the strange water planet, but then he heard a noise up in the tree.A furry animal hopped down and said “Hello.”“Who are you?” asked Raymond.“I’m the Queen of the Mamors,” said the furry animal. “Are you a friend of the Fish King?”“I am certainly not. My name is Raymond Mayweather, space traveler extraordinaire, and friend to all land animals. The Fish King tried to eat me!”“Then you have seen what has become of our planet. There used to be land everywhere. The only water on the entire planet was in a lake surrounded by rocks. That is where the Fish King lived until he broke down the rock wall and flooded our planet. The whirlpool was formed, and the rocks have flowed as a river ever since. We were forced to live here on the only land left,” said the Mamor Queen.“Finally, land!” thought Raymond. He got into his ship and pushed the red button one more time to turn it back into a space ship.

They told him how the Fish King had eaten all the smaller fish on the planet, and grown larger because of it. Raymond went back down to his ship and prepared to depart on a mission.“Where are you going?!” asked the Mamor king.“I’ve got an idea,” said Raymond.Raymond set off into the sky and settled his ship on the water, right above the Fish King’s sea castle. He put on his suit and swam back down into the castle. He found the Fish King searching the Royal Dining Hall for anything to eat. He looked hungrier than ever.“Fish King, I beseech you! Please come quickly. Mamors have fallen into the water and they cannot swim!” cried Raymond.The Fish King turned around with a grin on his face.“Huzzah, Huzzay, what luck today!” said the Fish King. “It will not matter that they cannot swim because I am going to eat them. Right after I eat you!”The Fish King took off after Raymond. Even though he was enormous, bigger even than Raymond’s spaceship, he was still a fish, and fish are very good swimmers. Raymond swam out of the castle in the same direction as before, but the Fish King was gaining on him. Just as he was about to get swallowed, the whirlpool of spinning water started to suck them both in.“Whooaaaaaaaaaaa!” said Raymond as they spun around.“Huzzah Huzzay, what’s this at play?” said the Fish King.Raymond got sucked through and out the other side of the planet. He flew right into the Mamor’s tree, then onto the ground beneath a large tree once again.Raymond was taken on a tour of the Mamor village atop the large tree. The Mamors were all very nice to him.

He flew right into the Mamor’s tree, then onto the ground beneath a large tree once again.“Where did you go, Raymond?” asked the Mamor Queen, as all the Mamors gathered around.“Look!” said Raymond, and he pointed to the fountain of water.The Fish King had not been spat out. He had grown too big to make it through and was now stuck inside. This stopped the whirlpool of water from spinning. And that stopped the river of rocks from flowing. Raymond took the Mamors on his ship and they went around collecting all the rocks together. After hours and hours of work, they had built a wall, and the Fish King had been trapped inside, along with all the water. This time the wall of the lake was twice as strong as before! Pretty soon the planet started looking completely different. Grass started to grow where the sea used to be. The Mamor Queen lived in the castle once again. Without any fish to eat, the Fish King started to get smaller, until he was no longer stuck, but this time he could not break down the wall.“Where did you go, Raymond?” asked the Mamor Queen, as all the Mamors gathered around.“Look!” said Raymond, and he pointed to the fountain of water.The Fish King had not been spat out.

They were so grateful that they made him an honorary Mamor, and told him that he was welcome on their planet whenever he liked. The Fish King was not as grateful for Raymond’s visit, but that is the way things go when you are a space traveler. Raymond Mayweather had tuned up his ship.He checked every latch and he fixed every drip.It was time to head home, with his mission completed.New friends had been made, and new foes were defeated.The Mamors were very grateful to Raymond for all of his help.

Warren was just a regular wolf pup... until he discovered that the full moon brings on a transformation unlike any other. Instead of a wild wolf, Warren becomes a polite young boy. For Warren, you see, is the dreaded Wereboy!if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0')};WEREBOYby Daniel ErricoThe wolves in the woods, grow as wild as trees.They do not say Thank You.

Each one of us here.”“Warren’s the wolf that you all knew before,It’s just that he happens to be that and more!”Sinclair stepped ahead, with his scraggily knees.“Excuse me,” he creaked with a cough and a weeze.“I have just the test, and we’ll know the truth soon.All wolves, be they true, howl up at the moon.”So the pack gathered round and they brought him outside.And Warren did something he hadn’t yet tried. He lifted his head and he puffed out his chest,Looked straight at the moon and he gave it his best.And from inside his heart, where it lay all along, Came not a howl, but a beautiful song. Soon one by one, all the wolves sat to listen.Until morning dew on the grass came to glisten. His parents, Sinclair, and the wolves from his pack,Watched the sun change him from Wereboy to back.And they saw him, this time, as they had not before.A wolf, and a boy, and forever, much more. At nighttime they look at the moon and they howl.But Warren was different, the youngest wolf pup.He would not go howl. He would not look up. Instead he ran back to his cave to go hide. And you would not believe what would happen inside.The brightest full moon would cause Warren to change.From a furry young wolf, to a creature most strange. His hair would grow short, and run right to his head.His paws would spread out, and form fingers instead.His snout would shrink down to a small little nub.While his ears became small, like a one-day-old cub.   His teeth would unsharpen, like pieces of corn.And always, somehow, there were clothes to be worn.He’d stand on two legs, and start walking around.And on his behind, not a tail to be found!His parents were shocked when they saw him transform.if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')};It certainly, wolfenly, wasn’t the norm.Warren became a polite, quiet, joy.For Warren, you see, was a dreaded… Wereboy!He’d only eat sandwiches, without the crust.He’d didn’t talk back. He preferred earning trust. They scratched at their heads when he cleaned up the cave.It wasn’t how wolves had been taught to behave.His bedtime, he found, was just one tad too late.So he marched off the sleep, without any debate. Instead of the floor, he would sleep on a bed. Leaves for a blanket and straw for his head. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-leader-1-0')};By morning he’d be a young wolf pup again.They all kept the secret together.

Michael spotted the source.“A cabin!” he whispered, and tied up his horse. Up to the window, he creeped and he crept.When he saw the old wizard, he cheered and he lept! “I found you!” he shouted, and burst through the door.(Though a king should know better than manners so poor). He insisted the wizard reverse what he’d done,Then he took back his wish and demanded the sun. “I’d rather eat wormtoads than do what you say,But I offer you this, a small game we can play. Inside of this box lies the magic you seek.”Sonto grinned wide and continued to speak. “Three keys for three locks, are the only way in.Answer three riddles, unlock them and win.But if you should fail, or not answer in time,Your title is forfeit, your kingdom is mine!” A king must be wise to rule over a nation,So, Michael was ready, without hesitation. They both took a seat, and the duck gave a glare.(The King, without knowing, had taken his chair). The box was between them, it sat in the middle.Sonto spoke first, to recite the first riddle. “I climb up a hill and reach out to the sky,And still you are taller- I ask, who am I?” “An ant,” said the king, as the old wizard frowned“Whose hill only sits but an inch off the ground.”  “Sonto the Bad” muttered, “Well…lucky guess.We’ll see how you handle the riddle up next.” “There’s nothing as large, not on land or at sea,But you won’t feel my weight, when you rest under me” The King answered back with the promptest reply,“Enormous and weightless, you must be the sky.” Sonto was mad, he did not like to lose.For last of his riddles, he knew which to choose.He would go fix things and settle this score! So rarely did Kings travel solo by horse,But Michael charged on, and he stayed on his course. The council had urged him that east would be best,But the King disagreed, and rode off to the west. The road was not safe, filled with perilous foes,Like armies of warthogs and red forest trolls. He battled these creatures without any fear,In brave, kingly ways that are not mentioned here. One evening the King paused to look at his map,And somehow, instead, he slipped into a nap. He slept rather soundly on leaf-covered ground,And awoke from his dream when he

leaf-covered ground,And awoke from his dream when he heard a loud sound. When he looked round a tree, Michael spotted the source.“A cabin!” he whispered, and tied up his horse. Up to the window, he creeped and he crept.When he saw the old wizard, he cheered and he lept! “I found you!” he shouted, and burst through the door.(Though a king should know better than manners so poor). He insisted the wizard reverse what he’d done,Then he took back his wish and demanded the sun. “I’d rather eat wormtoads than do what you say,But I offer you this, a small game we can play. Inside of this box lies the magic you seek.”Sonto grinned wide and continued to speak. “Three keys for three locks, are the only way in.Answer three riddles, unlock them and win.But if you should fail, or not answer in time,Your title is forfeit, your kingdom is mine!” A king must be wise to rule over a nation,So, Michael was ready, without hesitation. They both took a seat, and the duck gave a glare.(The King, without knowing, had taken his chair). The box was between them, it sat in the middle.Sonto spoke first, to recite the first riddle. “I climb up a hill and reach out to the sky,And still you are taller- I ask, who am I?” “An ant,” said the king, as the old wizard frowned“Whose hill only sits but an inch off the ground.”  “Sonto the Bad” muttered, “Well…lucky guess.We’ll see how you handle the riddle up next.” “There’s nothing as large, not on land or at sea,But you won’t feel my weight, when you rest under me” The King answered back with the promptest reply,“Enormous and weightless, you

Written by Daniel ErricoIllustrated by Ricky AudiIllustrated by Ricky AudiBefore words were words, a boy named Yes lived in a small village in a small kingdom. Yes was good at everything. He was the best, smartest and most liked person in his village. Yes had a brother, and his name was No. No was jealous of his brother, because he was not much good at anything himself. Whenever the villagers asked No for help, he refused because he didn’t like people very much.  Whenever someone asked Yes for a favor, he would gladly help, and he secretly didn’t mind the fact that it irritated No when he did.Yes had a brother, and his name was No. No was jealous of his brother, because he was not much good at anything himself.

Yes took good care of the great guck, and the icks, and the three-toed yock. [Keep in mind, my dear friend, that the guck, ick, and three-toed yock were very old animals, so you might know them by different names today.] No didn’t want to be bothered with the boring tasks involved with taking care of the animals. So instead of helping his brother, No went down to the lake and threw rocks into the water. One day Yes and No’s father, Okay went on a long journey and he left his two sons in charge of all the animals.

So instead of helping his brother, No went down to the lake and threw rocks into the water. A few days after his father left, Yes asked his brother to watch the three-toed yock while he went to find some food to eat. Instead of doing what Yes asked, No lay down, shut his eyes, and forgot about the yock.A few days after his father left, Yes asked his brother to watch the three-toed yock while he went to find some food to eat. Instead of doing what Yes asked, No lay down, shut his eyes, and forgot about the yock.It just so happened that the King had a personal road nearby, and he traveled on it often.  So often, that when the three-toed yock wandered onto the road, the King’s carriage was passing by and had to swerve to avoid hitting it.  The King was thrown from the carriage and fell to the ground and hurt himself.The King demanded to know why a three-toed yock had been allowed on his road and asked all the villagers for an explanation. Yes was always honest, so he told the King the entire story.The King thought for a moment, and then he came up with an idea that he was quite happy with. Yes and No were to work in the castle as his personal assistants as punishment for what was later referred to as the worst three-toed yock and carriage accident in the Kingdom’s history.It just so happened that the King had a personal road nearby, and he traveled on it often.  So often, that when the three-toed yock wandered onto the road, the King’s carriage was passing by and had to swerve to avoid hitting it.  The King was thrown from the carriage and fell to the ground and hurt himself.The King demanded to know why a three-toed yock had been allowed on his road and asked all the villagers for an explanation.

The King was quite sure that No was the worst servant in the entire world. The King needed help with many things around the castle because a King cannot be bothered with the daily tasks involved with running a Kingdom.  However, soon after his decision about the two brothers, the King realized that only Yes would be of any use to him as a servant.  Whenever the King asked No to bring him anything, it would get thrown away, broken, or eaten, without exception. The King was quite sure that No was the worst servant in the entire world. The brothers’ most important task was to help pick the food for a grand party that the King was throwing later that night. Cooks from all over the Kingdom lined up at the castle’s gate to offer the King their food for the party.  Of course, the King could not go and grab the food himself, so he asked Yes and No to do it for him.The first cook came up the gate and yelled to the Gatekeeper, “I bring my delicious ugberry pie for the King’s banquet!”  The King heard this and thought that ugberry pie would be perfect for such an event (and he would love to eat the leftovers). He didn’t want anything to happen to the ugberry pie, so he yelled “Yes!” and then asked him to go fetch it.The brothers’ most important task was to help pick the food for a grand party that the King was throwing later that night.

If the king liked a dish, he would yell “Yes!” and it would be included in the night’s feast. If he did not, everyone would hear a loud “NO!” and the dish would be destroyed moments later by a servant with a very bad attitude.Pretty soon this started catching on around the Kingdom, for if a King does something, his loyal subjects are never far behind.  If they didn’t want a second scoop of potatoes, they would say “No.” And if they liked what someone was offering, they would say, “Yes.” And ever since that day in a small village in a small kingdom, Yes has meant Yes, and No has meant No. This went on for hours.
