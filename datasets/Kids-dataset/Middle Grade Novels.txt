Before the school year started, I’d heard rumors about her, and within a week I realized that they were all true. For one thing, she did, in fact, wear the same outfit every day; the colors changed, but she always had on striped pants and a striped jacket. For another thing, she was mind-numbingly boring. The kind of boring that makes your eyes shut without your permission. The biggest problem, though, was the stories. She was obsessed with tales of former students who had become some kind of famous. The first couple of times weren’t bad, maybe even kind of interesting, but by the second week of school she had started repeating herself, just like her outfits. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-box-3-0')};By then, I knew all the stories by heart. The professional football player who was good at math. The politician who was a teacher’s pet. I knew every word. Instead of trying my hardest to listen, I spent most of class drawing in my notebook. Most classes, I drew imaginary places and then whipped up some creatures to fill them. They had horns where horns don’t go, fur where scales should be, and all the wings. They were odd, and they each had a story that I wanted to tell. But, on that day, I never even got to the first pair of wings. I had barely gotten started when the frog appeared and changed my life forever.It was a moment of exceptional boredom when I saw it. Its little green face was pressed up against the window nearest to me. My pencil stopped dead in its stubby tracks. I couldn’t stop looking at the frog and it couldn’t stop looking back. We were locked in a staring contest with unknown stakes. Maybe some frogs blinked, but with its eyes smushed against the glass, this one didn’t. Stagwood Forest was just beyond the schoolyard and it was riddled with frogs, but they always avoided people. I knew right away, in a way that I could think better than I could say, that this frog was different.I tried to listen back in to Miss Weaver, just in time to hear the end of her story about Martin Shandals, the now-famous comedian. Martin had transferred schools half way through the year, so I always felt to me like that one shouldn’t count. We were supposed to be learning long division, but something had reminded her of Martin. I knew exactly what bad joke she would end the story with, and much less about long division. “Whenever he acted up in class I’d say, ‘we’ve got a real comedian on our hands don’t we?’ And I was right!” she said with a giggle. I was sure that Miss Weaver would see the frog eventually, but I was wrong. Nobody did. When I looked again to see if it was still there, I noticed something shiny. It made me forget all about class, and Miss Weaver and Martin Shandals. There was no denying it: this frog had put on a tiny pair of glasses. I wanted to lecture it, to explain that frogs don’t wear glasses. It bothered me that it didn’t already know that. On top of that, it had been staring at me for at least five minutes. It seemed to be bordering on rude. Could a frog even be rude? I wasn’t sure. But, the bigger question was why it was so interested in me.I wasn't the type of kid who got attention. Teachers always wrote “needs to participate more” on my report cards (with a smiley face to make my parents feel better). I never got into trouble and barely ever stood out on purpose. A few years earlier, I accidentally peed my pants because my zipper had gotten stuck in the bathroom at the last moment. I tried to convince everyone that I had fallen into a puddle at recess. The custodian, Mr. Salazar, charged outside with a mop and brought me with him to point out the puddle. My guess is that we wasted a half-hour looking around at the dry gravel. Luckily, my mom dropped off some new clothes and nobody really noticed my wardrobe change (…or that it hadn’t rained in weeks). That’s how it was. Whether I did something spectacular or sneezed myself out of a chair, nobody cared, and almost nobody said my name. As far as school was concerned, all those things had happened to “some kid”. So, why would a frog with glasses jump up on a windowsill to stare at "some kid"? Teachers, on the other hand, were a different story. Once her lesson started back up, it didn’t take Miss Weaver long to realize that I wasn’t paying attention. She called me up to the blackboard to make an example out of me. “Since you don’t feel the need to listen, why don’t you solve a problem on the board instead?” she said, sitting down at her desk. My stomach immediately did a flip. Then it did a flop. The problem would take a minute or two to solve, and being in front of the class always made me nervous. How could I be expected to do anything when there was a spectacled frog staring me down?I walked to the right of the equation on the board so that I could check on the frog with a glance. Despite the distraction, I did my best to focus. Halfway through, I saw that the frog had moved towards the front of the classroom. It stopped at the window by Miss Weaver’s desk. It took me a moment to figure out what it was doing. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was trying to lift the window!Finishing the problem became almost impossible. I made a mistake and then quickly erased it. The next time I looked over, the window was open. Why should that surprise me? Of course a frog with glasses would also be super strong. The window was only open an inch, but that was enough for it to slip through. I dropped the chalk, and some of my classmates laughed. Bending down to pick it up, I tried convincing myself that when I stood back up again the frog would be gone. “It’s not there. I just think it’s there.”When I straightened up, the frog was sitting on Miss Weaver’s left shoulder. This was a brave frog. Her head blocked the class from seeing it, and I realized that I was still the only one who could. Either the frog was real or my imagination had outdone itself. It wasn’t all that surprising that Miss Weaver didn’t feel it there, because the shoulder pads inside her jacket were large and fluffy. I had heard that she rested her head on them like pillows during her breaks. There was a frog sitting on Miss Weaver’s shoulder and nobody else knew it. And I was supposed to be doing math.Now that it was closer, I could see the frog better. It didn’t look like some new species of frog to me. It looked like every other frog I had seen (except for the glasses). I wondered if they made contacts small enough for a frog. But, it wasn’t the right time to worry about frog vision. That would be a job for a frog eye doctor, anyway.I had daydreams all the time when I was drawing, and sometimes I got lost in them. It was possible, I thought, that my imagination had just carried me away. I tried one last time to explain the frog away as part of an elaborate daydream. I concentrated hard, finished the problem, and put the chalk down. The frog couldn’t be real. I shook my head confidently. When I turned to Miss Weaver, I saw the frog look me square in the eyes and nod. A moment later, it disappeared into Miss Weaver’s hair. Miss Weaver had been my teacher for a few months, and was best known around Stagwood for having a stack of black hair that rose a foot above her head.

Either the frog was real or my imagination had outdone itself. It wasn’t all that surprising that Miss Weaver didn’t feel it there, because the shoulder pads inside her jacket were large and fluffy. I had heard that she rested her head on them like pillows during her breaks. There was a frog sitting on Miss Weaver’s shoulder and nobody else knew it. And I was supposed to be doing math.Now that it was closer, I could see the frog better. It didn’t look like some new species of frog to me. It looked like every other frog I had seen (except for the glasses). I wondered if they made contacts small enough for a frog. But, it wasn’t the right time to worry about frog vision. That would be a job for a frog eye doctor, anyway.I had daydreams all the time when I was drawing, and sometimes I got lost in them. It was possible, I thought, that my imagination had just carried me away. I tried one last time to explain the frog away as part of an elaborate daydream. I concentrated hard, finished the problem, and put the chalk down. The frog couldn’t be real. I shook my head confidently. When I turned to Miss Weaver, I saw the frog look me square in the eyes and nod. A moment later, it disappeared into Miss Weaver’s hair. “Whenever he acted up in class I’d say, ‘we’ve got a real comedian on our hands don’t we?’ And I was right!” she said with a giggle. I was sure that Miss Weaver would see the frog eventually, but I was wrong. Nobody did. When I looked again to see if it was still there, I noticed something shiny. It made me forget all about class, and Miss Weaver and Martin Shandals. There was no denying it: this frog had put on a tiny pair of glasses. I wanted to lecture it, to explain that frogs don’t wear glasses. It bothered me that it didn’t already know that. On top of that, it had been staring at me for at least five minutes. It seemed to be bordering on rude. Could a frog even be rude? I wasn’t sure. But, the bigger question was why it was so interested in me.I wasn't the type of kid who got attention. Teachers always wrote “needs to participate more” on my report cards (with a smiley face to make my parents feel better). I never got into trouble and barely ever stood out on purpose. A few years earlier, I accidentally peed my pants because my zipper had gotten stuck in the bathroom at the last moment. I tried to convince everyone that I had fallen into a puddle at recess. The custodian, Mr. Salazar, charged outside with a mop and brought me with him to point out the puddle. My guess is that we wasted a half-hour looking around at the dry gravel. Luckily, my mom dropped off some new clothes and nobody really noticed my wardrobe change (…or that it hadn’t rained in weeks). That’s how it was. Whether I did something spectacular or sneezed myself out of a chair, nobody cared, and almost nobody said my name. As far as school was concerned, all those things had happened to “some kid”. So, why would a frog with glasses jump up on a windowsill to stare at "some kid"? Teachers, on the other hand, were a different story. Once her lesson started back up, it didn’t take Miss Weaver long to realize that I wasn’t paying attention. She called me up to the blackboard to make an example out of me. “Since you don’t feel the need to listen, why don’t you solve a problem on the board instead?” she said, sitting down at her desk. My stomach immediately did a flip. Then it did a flop. The problem would take a minute or two to solve, and being in front of the class always made me nervous. How could I be expected to do anything when there was a spectacled frog staring me down?I walked to the right of the equation on the board so that I could check on the frog with a glance. Despite the distraction, I did my best to focus. Halfway through, I saw that the frog had moved towards the front of the classroom. It stopped at the window by Miss Weaver’s desk. It took me a moment to figure out what it was doing. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was trying to lift the window!Finishing the problem became almost impossible. I made a mistake and then quickly erased it. The next time I looked over, the window was open. Why should that surprise me? Of course a frog with glasses would also be super strong. The window was only open an inch, but that was enough for it to slip through. I dropped the chalk, and some of my classmates laughed.

I just think it’s there.”When I straightened up, the frog was sitting on Miss Weaver’s left shoulder. This was a brave frog. Her head blocked the class from seeing it, and I realized that I was still the only one who could. Either the frog was real or my imagination had outdone itself. It wasn’t all that surprising that Miss Weaver didn’t feel it there, because the shoulder pads inside her jacket were large and fluffy. I had heard that she rested her head on them like pillows during her breaks. There was a frog sitting on Miss Weaver’s shoulder and nobody else knew it. And I was supposed to be doing math.Now that it was closer, I could see the frog better. It didn’t look like some new species of frog to me. It looked like every other frog I had seen (except for the glasses). I wondered if they made contacts small enough for a frog. But, it wasn’t the right time to worry about frog vision. That would be a job for a frog eye doctor, anyway.I had daydreams all the time when I was drawing, and sometimes I got lost in them. It was possible, I thought, that my imagination had just carried me away. I tried one last time to explain the frog away as part of an elaborate daydream. I concentrated hard, finished the problem, and put the chalk down. The frog couldn’t be real. I shook my head confidently. When I turned to Miss Weaver, I saw the frog look me square in the eyes and nod. A moment later, it disappeared into Miss Weaver’s hair. When I straightened up, the frog was sitting on Miss Weaver’s left shoulder. This was a brave frog. Her head blocked the class from seeing it, and I realized that I was still the only one who could.

His mom was usually busy with his siblings, so Soy was left to play outside a lot. By third grade, he had caught a pet turtle, salamander, and flying squirrel. Unfortunately, his older brothers Rick and Hank stole the squirrel and kept it in their room. Once a week they played a game where Rick threw the squirrel from the second story window, and Hank caught it midair with a trash can as it glided down. Soy tried to get them to stop, but they never listened.  The frog didn’t put up much of a fight. I started to wonder if it actually wanted to be caught. “Do you believe me now?” I asked.Soy peaked inside his hands, and then lifted his head. "Well… this frog is wearing glasses. I’ll give you that.”Both of our minds were racing with questions.“Let’s bring it to my treehouse, so we can figure this out,” I said. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0_1')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0_2')};.banner-1-multi-108{border:none!important;display:block!important;float:none;line-height:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-height:250px;min-width:300px;padding:0;text-align:center!important} I had built most of the treehouse in my backyard myself. My mom and dad insisted on one of them being there when I used certain tools, but that was about it. Building things always made me feel good afterwards, and I had gotten pretty good at it. The treehouse had been done for a while, but there were still a few things I wanted to add to it before winter.   When we got there, I told Soy to use the elevator. It was really just a rope with a weighted pulley system, but I called it the elevator anyway. We used it when we needed to carry things that we couldn’t bring up on the ladder. I climbed up and then lowered it down for him. All those years of critter-handling had paid off, and he got it inside the treehouse without any problem. I shut the door and quadruple-locked it, so that the frog couldn’t run away (and also to give us some privacy).  “Okay, Soy,” I said, "let him loose." Soy lowered his hands and opened them, letting the frog hop to the floor of the treehouse. I had a small drafting table, drawings, and bits of wood all over, which provided plenty of places for the frog to hide. Luckily for us, it didn’t move at all. Instead it looked up at me, and in a loud voice said, “What do you mean, him?”Soy fell backwards from a crouch onto his rear. The frog was looking right at me, waiting for an answer, but all I could do was shake my head."It’s rude to assume I’m a ‘he’, don’t you think? I happen to be female,” said the frog proudly. Soy was now holding his head with both hands. “It can talk!!” he said in disbelief."Well, now calling me an ‘it’, after I just told you I was a girl, is just plain inconsiderate, Soy,” she said.  I knelt down closer, looking for anything that might make sense of it all. Maybe the frog was a robot? But nothing about the way it moved was robotic. And would a “Made in China” sticker really make me feel better? It… she… had just called my best friend by his first name! Soy was so flabbergasted that he was gnawing on his backpack strap, so I doubted that they had met before.  “I’m sorry,” I said to the frog, kneeling down, “we didn’t mean anything by it. Truly.”The frog hopped even closer and said, “You’ve always been kind,” then whispered, “it’s a powerful thing. Remember that.”“I will,” I said, amazed that I had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds. “But, um, if you don’t mind me asking, how is it that you can talk?” I said. By that point Soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth. The frog crooked her head at me slightly. “Do you think that humans are the only animals that can talk?” she asked. I was startled. Was it possible that animals could talk, and somehow no one in the world knew about it? Was everything that I thought about animals wrong? I took a seat on the floor, too. Soy spit out his strap. "That’s not cool,” he said. “I tell my pet iguana all of my secrets. If he can talk, I need to know who he’s been talking to.”The frog gave out a little laugh, then she said, “Oh, I’m just kidding. Animals can’t talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly.” I was embarrassed, but mostly relieved. “What about some kind of iguana sign language?” asked Soy, still nervous. Ignoring Soy's question, I asked the frog, “How is it that you can? Talk, I mean." “For starters, I’m not a frog,” she explained. “The only reason that I—” Without any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. “What are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?” asked my mom sternly.I searched my brain for an answer that didn’t have the word frog in it. “Soy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away." I replied.“He’s a clever one” the frog whispered to Soy. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0_1')};.large-leaderboard-2-multi-109{border:none!important;display:block!important;float:none;line-height:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center!important} I gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that a frog had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a female voice, she would break down that door, quadruple-lock or no. I added another lock every time she broke down the door. A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke. I added the fourth lock that night, but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for “mom strength”. For the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”.  “Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you,” my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door, “and he looks pretty official. He’s even wearing a fancy suit with a shiny yellow bowtie. Don’t worry though, he assured me you’ve done nothing wrong.” “Yellow!” screeched the frog.“What?” asked my mom.“Oh, I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she said.“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I said nervously. “Oh. I didn’t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,” she said, getting even closer to the door, “because that’s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.”  I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house. The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house. I was amazed at how high she could jump. It was immediately clear that she could have left any time that she had wanted. “Whatever you do, don’t mention me,” the frog whispered frantically. “I’ll find you later.” And with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below. The frog didn’t put up much of a fight.

My mom and dad insisted on one of them being there when I used certain tools, but that was about it. Building things always made me feel good afterwards, and I had gotten pretty good at it. The treehouse had been done for a while, but there were still a few things I wanted to add to it before winter.   When we got there, I told Soy to use the elevator. It was really just a rope with a weighted pulley system, but I called it the elevator anyway. We used it when we needed to carry things that we couldn’t bring up on the ladder. I climbed up and then lowered it down for him. All those years of critter-handling had paid off, and he got it inside the treehouse without any problem. I shut the door and quadruple-locked it, so that the frog couldn’t run away (and also to give us some privacy).  “Okay, Soy,” I said, "let him loose." Soy lowered his hands and opened them, letting the frog hop to the floor of the treehouse. I had a small drafting table, drawings, and bits of wood all over, which provided plenty of places for the frog to hide. Luckily for us, it didn’t move at all. Instead it looked up at me, and in a loud voice said, “What do you mean, him?”Soy fell backwards from a crouch onto his rear. The frog was looking right at me, waiting for an answer, but all I could do was shake my head."It’s rude to assume I’m a ‘he’, don’t you think? I happen to be female,” said the frog proudly. Soy was now holding his head with both hands. “It can talk!!” he said in disbelief."Well, now calling me an ‘it’, after I just told you I was a girl, is just plain inconsiderate, Soy,” she said.  I knelt down closer, looking for anything that might make sense of it all. Maybe the frog was a robot? But nothing about the way it moved was robotic. And would a “Made in China” sticker really make me feel better? It… she… had just called my best friend by his first name! Soy was so flabbergasted that he was gnawing on his backpack strap, so I doubted that they had met before.  “I’m sorry,” I said to the frog, kneeling down, “we didn’t mean anything by it. Truly.”The frog hopped even closer and said, “You’ve always been kind,” then whispered, “it’s a powerful thing. Remember that.”“I will,” I said, amazed that I had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds. “But, um, if you don’t mind me asking, how is it that you can talk?” I said. By that point Soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth. The frog crooked her head at me slightly. “Do you think that humans are the only animals that can talk?” she asked. I was startled. Was it possible that animals could talk, and somehow no one in the world knew about it? Was everything that I thought about animals wrong? I took a seat on the floor, too. Soy spit out his strap. "That’s not cool,” he said. “I tell my pet iguana all of my secrets. If he can talk, I need to know who he’s been talking to.”The frog gave out a little laugh, then she said, “Oh, I’m just kidding. Animals can’t talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly.” I was embarrassed, but mostly relieved. “What about some kind of iguana sign language?” asked Soy, still nervous. Ignoring Soy's question, I asked the frog, “How is it that you can? Talk, I mean." “For starters, I’m not a frog,” she explained. “The only reason that I—” Without any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. “What are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?” asked my mom sternly.I searched my brain for an answer that didn’t have the word frog in it. “Soy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away." I replied.“He’s a clever one” the frog whispered to Soy. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0_1')};.large-leaderboard-2-multi-109{border:none!important;display:block!important;float:none;line-height:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center!important} I gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that a frog had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a female voice, she would break down that door, quadruple-lock or no. I added another lock every time she broke down the door. A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke. I added the fourth lock that night, but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for “mom strength”. For the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”.  “Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you,” my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door, “and he looks pretty official. He’s even wearing a fancy suit with a shiny yellow bowtie. Don’t worry though, he assured me you’ve done nothing wrong.” “Yellow!” screeched the frog.“What?” asked my mom.“Oh, I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she said.“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I said nervously. “Oh. I didn’t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,” she said, getting even closer to the door, “because that’s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.”  I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house. The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house. I was amazed at how high she could jump. It was immediately clear that she could have left any time that she had wanted. “Whatever you do, don’t mention me,” the frog whispered frantically. “I’ll find you later.” And with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below.Both of our minds were racing with questions.“Let’s bring it to my treehouse, so we can figure this out,” I said. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0_1')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0_2')};.banner-1-multi-108{border:none!important;display:block!important;float:none;line-height:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-height:250px;min-width:300px;padding:0;text-align:center!important} I had built most of the treehouse in my backyard myself.

I replied.“He’s a clever one” the frog whispered to Soy. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0_1')};.large-leaderboard-2-multi-109{border:none!important;display:block!important;float:none;line-height:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center!important} I gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that a frog had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a female voice, she would break down that door, quadruple-lock or no. I added another lock every time she broke down the door. A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke. I added the fourth lock that night, but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for “mom strength”. For the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”.  “Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you,” my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door, “and he looks pretty official. He’s even wearing a fancy suit with a shiny yellow bowtie. Don’t worry though, he assured me you’ve done nothing wrong.” “Yellow!” screeched the frog.“What?” asked my mom.“Oh, I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she said.“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I said nervously. “Oh. I didn’t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,” she said, getting even closer to the door, “because that’s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.”  I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house. The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house. I was amazed at how high she could jump. It was immediately clear that she could have left any time that she had wanted. “Whatever you do, don’t mention me,” the frog whispered frantically. “I’ll find you later.” And with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below.When we got there, I told Soy to use the elevator. It was really just a rope with a weighted pulley system, but I called it the elevator anyway. We used it when we needed to carry things that we couldn’t bring up on the ladder. I climbed up and then lowered it down for him. All those years of critter-handling had paid off, and he got it inside the treehouse without any problem. I shut the door and quadruple-locked it, so that the frog couldn’t run away (and also to give us some privacy).  “Okay, Soy,” I said, "let him loose." Soy lowered his hands and opened them, letting the frog hop to the floor of the treehouse. I had a small drafting table, drawings, and bits of wood all over, which provided plenty of places for the frog to hide. Luckily for us, it didn’t move at all. Instead it looked up at me, and in a loud voice said, “What do you mean, him?”Soy fell backwards from a crouch onto his rear. The frog was looking right at me, waiting for an answer, but all I could do was shake my head."It’s rude to assume I’m a ‘he’, don’t you think? I happen to be female,” said the frog proudly. Soy was now holding his head with both hands. “It can talk!!” he said in disbelief."Well, now calling me an ‘it’, after I just told you I was a girl, is just plain inconsiderate, Soy,” she said.  I knelt down closer, looking for anything that might make sense of it all. Maybe the frog was a robot? But nothing about the way it moved was robotic. And would a “Made in China” sticker really make me feel better? It… she… had just called my best friend by his first name! Soy was so flabbergasted that he was gnawing on his backpack strap, so I doubted that they had met before.  “I’m sorry,” I said to the frog, kneeling down, “we didn’t mean anything by it. Truly.”The frog hopped even closer and said, “You’ve always been kind,” then whispered, “it’s a powerful thing. Remember that.”“I will,” I said, amazed that I had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds. “But, um, if you don’t mind me asking, how is it that you can talk?” I said. By that point Soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth. The frog crooked her head at me slightly. “Do you think that humans are the only animals that can talk?” she asked. I was startled. Was it possible that animals could talk, and somehow no one in the world knew about it? Was everything that I thought about animals wrong? I took a seat on the floor, too. Soy spit out his strap. "That’s not cool,” he said. “I tell my pet iguana all of my secrets. If he can talk, I need to know who he’s been talking to.”The frog gave out a little laugh, then she said, “Oh, I’m just kidding. Animals can’t talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly.” I was embarrassed, but mostly relieved. “What about some kind of iguana sign language?” asked Soy, still nervous. Ignoring Soy's question, I asked the frog, “How is it that you can? Talk, I mean." “For starters, I’m not a frog,” she explained. “The only reason that I—” Without any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. “What are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?” asked my mom sternly.I searched my brain for an answer that didn’t have the word frog in it. “Soy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away."

Soy was so flabbergasted that he was gnawing on his backpack strap, so I doubted that they had met before.  “I’m sorry,” I said to the frog, kneeling down, “we didn’t mean anything by it. Truly.”The frog hopped even closer and said, “You’ve always been kind,” then whispered, “it’s a powerful thing. Remember that.”“I will,” I said, amazed that I had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds. “But, um, if you don’t mind me asking, how is it that you can talk?” I said. By that point Soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth. The frog crooked her head at me slightly. “Do you think that humans are the only animals that can talk?” she asked. I was startled. Was it possible that animals could talk, and somehow no one in the world knew about it? Was everything that I thought about animals wrong? I took a seat on the floor, too. Soy spit out his strap. "That’s not cool,” he said. “I tell my pet iguana all of my secrets. If he can talk, I need to know who he’s been talking to.”The frog gave out a little laugh, then she said, “Oh, I’m just kidding. Animals can’t talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly.” I was embarrassed, but mostly relieved. “What about some kind of iguana sign language?” asked Soy, still nervous. Ignoring Soy's question, I asked the frog, “How is it that you can? Talk, I mean." “For starters, I’m not a frog,” she explained. “The only reason that I—” Without any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. “What are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?” asked my mom sternly.I searched my brain for an answer that didn’t have the word frog in it. “Soy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away." I replied.“He’s a clever one” the frog whispered to Soy. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0_1')};.large-leaderboard-2-multi-109{border:none!important;display:block!important;float:none;line-height:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center!important} I gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that a frog had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a female voice, she would break down that door, quadruple-lock or no. I added another lock every time she broke down the door. A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke. I added the fourth lock that night, but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for “mom strength”. For the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”.  “Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you,” my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door, “and he looks pretty official. He’s even wearing a fancy suit with a shiny yellow bowtie. Don’t worry though, he assured me you’ve done nothing wrong.” “Yellow!” screeched the frog.“What?” asked my mom.“Oh, I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she said.“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I said nervously. “Oh. I didn’t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,” she said, getting even closer to the door, “because that’s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.”  I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house. The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house. I was amazed at how high she could jump. It was immediately clear that she could have left any time that she had wanted. “Whatever you do, don’t mention me,” the frog whispered frantically. “I’ll find you later.” And with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below. I knelt down closer, looking for anything that might make sense of it all.

Soy spit out his strap. "That’s not cool,” he said. “I tell my pet iguana all of my secrets. If he can talk, I need to know who he’s been talking to.”The frog gave out a little laugh, then she said, “Oh, I’m just kidding. Animals can’t talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly.” I was embarrassed, but mostly relieved. “What about some kind of iguana sign language?” asked Soy, still nervous. Ignoring Soy's question, I asked the frog, “How is it that you can? Talk, I mean." “For starters, I’m not a frog,” she explained. “The only reason that I—” Without any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. “What are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?” asked my mom sternly.I searched my brain for an answer that didn’t have the word frog in it. “Soy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away." I replied.“He’s a clever one” the frog whispered to Soy. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-large-leaderboard-2-0_1')};.large-leaderboard-2-multi-109{border:none!important;display:block!important;float:none;line-height:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center!important} I gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that a frog had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a female voice, she would break down that door, quadruple-lock or no. I added another lock every time she broke down the door. A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke. I added the fourth lock that night, but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for “mom strength”. For the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”.  “Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you,” my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door, “and he looks pretty official. He’s even wearing a fancy suit with a shiny yellow bowtie. Don’t worry though, he assured me you’ve done nothing wrong.” “Yellow!” screeched the frog.“What?” asked my mom.“Oh, I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she said.“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I said nervously. “Oh. I didn’t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,” she said, getting even closer to the door, “because that’s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.”  I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house. The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house. I was amazed at how high she could jump. It was immediately clear that she could have left any time that she had wanted. “Whatever you do, don’t mention me,” the frog whispered frantically. “I’ll find you later.” And with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below.I was startled.

Don’t worry though, he assured me you’ve done nothing wrong.” “Yellow!” screeched the frog.“What?” asked my mom.“Oh, I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she said.“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I said nervously. “Oh. I didn’t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,” she said, getting even closer to the door, “because that’s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.”  I heard my mom climb down the ladder and then watched her go back inside the house. The frog jumped up to the open window which faced the woods behind my house. I was amazed at how high she could jump. It was immediately clear that she could have left any time that she had wanted. “Whatever you do, don’t mention me,” the frog whispered frantically. “I’ll find you later.” And with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below. I gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that a frog had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a female voice, she would break down that door, quadruple-lock or no. I added another lock every time she broke down the door. A few weeks earlier Soy had lit a firecracker inside the treehouse and she had noticed the smoke. I added the fourth lock that night, but was more sure than ever that metal was no match for “mom strength”. For the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”.  “Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you,” my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door, “and he looks pretty official.

But here I am!” Soy shouted. Tyrt stood up too, but as a fairy, it didn’t have the dramatic effect that he had intended. “Soy, just calm down,” I said to him. "They’re trying to help us.”“They’re the whole reason we’re in this mess,” Soy said gruffly. “How do we even know that we belong here?” Soy had made a pretty good point. It seemed that Ream was only interested in us because Deli was, and she still hadn’t shown us any evidence that either Soy or I was the hero. For a moment, I thought that maybe everything was a mistake, and that we might be able to end this all and go home. The thought didn’t make me sad, but it didn’t make me happy either. “I believe we can answer that,” said Deli from my shoulder.As she hopped onto the table in front of Tryt, she spoke only to him. “It’s time to show them,” she asserted.  Tryt’s face told me that he wasn’t thrilled about the idea. He wore the same expression that I had when my mom insisted that I do my homework right when I got home. I knew that she was right, and that it wasn’t her fault she was right, but still… harumph. Tryt raised one of his neon pink wings and motioned some fairies over, using it like an arm. Four fairies came flying in from the side of the courtyard opposite from where we entered. They were carrying a large, dark brown book. These fairies had on medieval-looking armor made from the same glass as the chairs. The book they were carrying was thicker than a dictionary and wider. It was the kind of book that Soy would have openly protested if we had been assigned to read it for our class.*It also seemed that the book was heavier than it looked, since the fairies were out of breath by the time they put it down on the table. Tryt shooed them away with his wing, and they disappeared straight up and out of the courtyard.  *Soy once proclaimed that making kids reading anything over one hundred pages was technically illegal, but he never found the documents to support it. When the fairies left, Soy and I stood up at the same time to inspect. It was a dusty, rundown book. There were no words on the cover, but it was hard to say whether they had rubbed off, or were just never there at all. Along the center, a buckle with a lock ran horizontally across, made of the strange yellowish-gold that I now knew. “Stonegold?” I asked.“Yes,” said Tryt, “only a magic pen may write in the Book of Lore, but it does not hurt to be safe.” “Why would anybody want to mess with the book?” asked Soy.“The Book of Lore chronicles every fairytale throughout history. Changing them would change the fate of the world,” answered Tryt indignantly. Soy didn’t respond this time.  All four of us gathered closer, hovering over the book as Tryt held up his shiny pen. Without a word, he turned it over, placed the crown on top inside the stonegold lock and turned it. The buckle surrendered, opening up with a low hiss. I thought the pages smelled like pine trees, but didn’t say it out loud. Tryt began flipping through the book and it was hard to see the words. Whenever I did catch a glimpse, the writing started off hard to focus on, but then got more clear. The words were written in fancy, old looking letters.Soy’s face was getting closer and closer to the pages by the second.  “It’s in English,” he said finally, “I thought it might be in fairy or elvish, or something weird like that.” Tryt didn’t look up to acknowledge Soy, but it was obvious from his voice that he was agitated. “It is not ‘in English’. The fairytales in the Book of Lore appear in the first language of whomever is reading it,” he said. “That’s English,” said Soy, pointing at the book.“Soy, to you it is in English, but to someone else it may be in French or German,” said Deli. “If it was in French of German, I wouldn’t be able to read it,” Soy explained politely, “so that’s how I know it’s in English.” Tryt let out an un-fairylike grunt and continued flipping through the pages while he spoke. “The characters in these stories had their fates sealed by the outcomes written here. But Ream’s first fairytale is unique in its ending.”“Ream was in a fairytale?” I asked with surprise. That seemed like a big deal to me. “Yes," Tryt replied. "When a hero or heroine defeats a villain, their story and their fate are sealed within this book. All the rile of those defeated, all of their magic, is confined within the book so that they may never use it against the world again. And every villain inside the Book of Lore was defeated, save one." “Ream,” I said gravely. “Yes,” replied Deli, “instead of defeat, his tale ended with an escape. That is why he was able to hold onto his rile.”“He was injured. Pierced with stonegold, to be exact,” Tryt said as he slowed his page turning. “And once stonegold pierces you, it may never be removed or covered. That is why Ream always has a piece of stonegold visible, regardless of his disguise." “But nobody has explained yet why he’s after us,” said Soy. “We didn’t do anything to him!” “You’re not a patient child, are you, Soy?” asked Tryt in a half-question.“And you don’t own a bookmark,” rebutted Soy, not at all in the form of a question.  Tryt turned one last page, then covered it with his fairyhand, unleashing a slew of sparkles that shot out to conceal the center. “This is your fairytale. And this is the reason that Ream is after you,” Tryt said, looking directly at me. “It may be the last fairytale ever written. All the fairytales that came before it, and all the creatures inside of them are at stake. Ream and the forces of rile are trying to change their fate.” “But, why are you calling it mine?” I asked shyly. Deli looked up at me. “Because you are the hero,” she replied. Tryt moved his hand, and the sparkles flew away. Written on the page in a thousand languages, but English to me, was the title: The Boy and The Flying Bed. And underneath it, there was a small drawing. Tyrt stood up too, but as a fairy, it didn’t have the dramatic effect that he had intended. “Soy, just calm down,” I said to him. "They’re trying to help us.”“They’re the whole reason we’re in this mess,” Soy said gruffly. “How do we even know that we belong here?” Soy had made a pretty good point.

That is why he was able to hold onto his rile.”“He was injured. Pierced with stonegold, to be exact,” Tryt said as he slowed his page turning. “And once stonegold pierces you, it may never be removed or covered. That is why Ream always has a piece of stonegold visible, regardless of his disguise." “But nobody has explained yet why he’s after us,” said Soy. “We didn’t do anything to him!” “You’re not a patient child, are you, Soy?” asked Tryt in a half-question.“And you don’t own a bookmark,” rebutted Soy, not at all in the form of a question.  Tryt turned one last page, then covered it with his fairyhand, unleashing a slew of sparkles that shot out to conceal the center. “This is your fairytale. And this is the reason that Ream is after you,” Tryt said, looking directly at me. “It may be the last fairytale ever written. All the fairytales that came before it, and all the creatures inside of them are at stake. Ream and the forces of rile are trying to change their fate.” “But, why are you calling it mine?” I asked shyly. Deli looked up at me. “Because you are the hero,” she replied. Tryt moved his hand, and the sparkles flew away. Written on the page in a thousand languages, but English to me, was the title: The Boy and The Flying Bed. And underneath it, there was a small drawing. “I believe we can answer that,” said Deli from my shoulder.As she hopped onto the table in front of Tryt, she spoke only to him. “It’s time to show them,” she asserted.  Tryt’s face told me that he wasn’t thrilled about the idea. He wore the same expression that I had when my mom insisted that I do my homework right when I got home. I knew that she was right, and that it wasn’t her fault she was right, but still… harumph. Tryt raised one of his neon pink wings and motioned some fairies over, using it like an arm. Four fairies came flying in from the side of the courtyard opposite from where we entered. They were carrying a large, dark brown book. These fairies had on medieval-looking armor made from the same glass as the chairs. The book they were carrying was thicker than a dictionary and wider. It was the kind of book that Soy would have openly protested if we had been assigned to read it for our class.*It also seemed that the book was heavier than it looked, since the fairies were out of breath by the time they put it down on the table. Tryt shooed them away with his wing, and they disappeared straight up and out of the courtyard.  *Soy once proclaimed that making kids reading anything over one hundred pages was technically illegal, but he never found the documents to support it. When the fairies left, Soy and I stood up at the same time to inspect. It was a dusty, rundown book. There were no words on the cover, but it was hard to say whether they had rubbed off, or were just never there at all. Along the center, a buckle with a lock ran horizontally across, made of the strange yellowish-gold that I now knew. “Stonegold?” I asked.“Yes,” said Tryt, “only a magic pen may write in the Book of Lore, but it does not hurt to be safe.” “Why would anybody want to mess with the book?” asked Soy.“The Book of Lore chronicles every fairytale throughout history. Changing them would change the fate of the world,” answered Tryt indignantly. Soy didn’t respond this time.  All four of us gathered closer, hovering over the book as Tryt held up his shiny pen. Without a word, he turned it over, placed the crown on top inside the stonegold lock and turned it. The buckle surrendered, opening up with a low hiss. I thought the pages smelled like pine trees, but didn’t say it out loud. Tryt began flipping through the book and it was hard to see the words. Whenever I did catch a glimpse, the writing started off hard to focus on, but then got more clear. The words were written in fancy, old looking letters.Soy’s face was getting closer and closer to the pages by the second.  “It’s in English,” he said finally, “I thought it might be in fairy or elvish, or something weird like that.” Tryt didn’t look up to acknowledge Soy, but it was obvious from his voice that he was agitated. “It is not ‘in English’. The fairytales in the Book of Lore appear in the first language of whomever is reading it,” he said. “That’s English,” said Soy, pointing at the book.“Soy, to you it is in English, but to someone else it may be in French or German,” said Deli. “If it was in French of German, I wouldn’t be able to read it,” Soy explained politely, “so that’s how I know it’s in English.” Tryt let out an un-fairylike grunt and continued flipping through the pages while he spoke. “The characters in these stories had their fates sealed by the outcomes written here. But Ream’s first fairytale is unique in its ending.”“Ream was in a fairytale?” I asked with surprise. That seemed like a big deal to me. “Yes," Tryt replied. "When a hero or heroine defeats a villain, their story and their fate are sealed within this book. All the rile of those defeated, all of their magic, is confined within the book so that they may never use it against the world again.

The fairytales in the Book of Lore appear in the first language of whomever is reading it,” he said. “That’s English,” said Soy, pointing at the book.“Soy, to you it is in English, but to someone else it may be in French or German,” said Deli. “If it was in French of German, I wouldn’t be able to read it,” Soy explained politely, “so that’s how I know it’s in English.” Tryt let out an un-fairylike grunt and continued flipping through the pages while he spoke. “The characters in these stories had their fates sealed by the outcomes written here. But Ream’s first fairytale is unique in its ending.”“Ream was in a fairytale?” I asked with surprise. That seemed like a big deal to me. “Yes," Tryt replied. "When a hero or heroine defeats a villain, their story and their fate are sealed within this book. All the rile of those defeated, all of their magic, is confined within the book so that they may never use it against the world again. And every villain inside the Book of Lore was defeated, save one." “Ream,” I said gravely. “Yes,” replied Deli, “instead of defeat, his tale ended with an escape. That is why he was able to hold onto his rile.”“He was injured. Pierced with stonegold, to be exact,” Tryt said as he slowed his page turning. “And once stonegold pierces you, it may never be removed or covered. That is why Ream always has a piece of stonegold visible, regardless of his disguise." “But nobody has explained yet why he’s after us,” said Soy. “We didn’t do anything to him!” “You’re not a patient child, are you, Soy?” asked Tryt in a half-question.“And you don’t own a bookmark,” rebutted Soy, not at all in the form of a question.  Tryt turned one last page, then covered it with his fairyhand, unleashing a slew of sparkles that shot out to conceal the center. “This is your fairytale. And this is the reason that Ream is after you,” Tryt said, looking directly at me. “It may be the last fairytale ever written. All the fairytales that came before it, and all the creatures inside of them are at stake. Ream and the forces of rile are trying to change their fate.” “But, why are you calling it mine?” I asked shyly. Deli looked up at me. “Because you are the hero,” she replied. Tryt moved his hand, and the sparkles flew away. Written on the page in a thousand languages, but English to me, was the title: The Boy and The Flying Bed. And underneath it, there was a small drawing. *Soy once proclaimed that making kids reading anything over one hundred pages was technically illegal, but he never found the documents to support it. When the fairies left, Soy and I stood up at the same time to inspect. It was a dusty, rundown book. There were no words on the cover, but it was hard to say whether they had rubbed off, or were just never there at all. Along the center, a buckle with a lock ran horizontally across, made of the strange yellowish-gold that I now knew. “Stonegold?” I asked.“Yes,” said Tryt, “only a magic pen may write in the Book of Lore, but it does not hurt to be safe.” “Why would anybody want to mess with the book?” asked Soy.“The Book of Lore chronicles every fairytale throughout history. Changing them would change the fate of the world,” answered Tryt indignantly. Soy didn’t respond this time.  All four of us gathered closer, hovering over the book as Tryt held up his shiny pen. Without a word, he turned it over, placed the crown on top inside the stonegold lock and turned it. The buckle surrendered, opening up with a low hiss. I thought the pages smelled like pine trees, but didn’t say it out loud. Tryt began flipping through the book and it was hard to see the words.

And underneath it, there was a small drawing. Soy’s face was getting closer and closer to the pages by the second.  “It’s in English,” he said finally, “I thought it might be in fairy or elvish, or something weird like that.” Tryt didn’t look up to acknowledge Soy, but it was obvious from his voice that he was agitated. “It is not ‘in English’. The fairytales in the Book of Lore appear in the first language of whomever is reading it,” he said. “That’s English,” said Soy, pointing at the book.“Soy, to you it is in English, but to someone else it may be in French or German,” said Deli. “If it was in French of German, I wouldn’t be able to read it,” Soy explained politely, “so that’s how I know it’s in English.” Tryt let out an un-fairylike grunt and continued flipping through the pages while he spoke. “The characters in these stories had their fates sealed by the outcomes written here. But Ream’s first fairytale is unique in its ending.”“Ream was in a fairytale?” I asked with surprise. That seemed like a big deal to me. “Yes," Tryt replied. "When a hero or heroine defeats a villain, their story and their fate are sealed within this book. All the rile of those defeated, all of their magic, is confined within the book so that they may never use it against the world again. And every villain inside the Book of Lore was defeated, save one." “Ream,” I said gravely. “Yes,” replied Deli, “instead of defeat, his tale ended with an escape. That is why he was able to hold onto his rile.”“He was injured. Pierced with stonegold, to be exact,” Tryt said as he slowed his page turning. “And once stonegold pierces you, it may never be removed or covered. That is why Ream always has a piece of stonegold visible, regardless of his disguise." “But nobody has explained yet why he’s after us,” said Soy. “We didn’t do anything to him!” “You’re not a patient child, are you, Soy?” asked Tryt in a half-question.“And you don’t own a bookmark,” rebutted Soy, not at all in the form of a question.  Tryt turned one last page, then covered it with his fairyhand, unleashing a slew of sparkles that shot out to conceal the center. “This is your fairytale. And this is the reason that Ream is after you,” Tryt said, looking directly at me. “It may be the last fairytale ever written. All the fairytales that came before it, and all the creatures inside of them are at stake. Ream and the forces of rile are trying to change their fate.” “But, why are you calling it mine?” I asked shyly. Deli looked up at me. “Because you are the hero,” she replied. Tryt moved his hand, and the sparkles flew away.
