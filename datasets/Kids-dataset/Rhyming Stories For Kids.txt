We don't know exactly where Om Nom Nom came from ... or what he is, but we do know a few things. The first is that he keeps popping up, and the second is that he will eat anything! Om Nom Nom is a whimsical and silly rhyming tale which spotlights the monorhyme (when all the lines rhyme with each other). Copyright © 2007-2021, Freechildrenstories.com, Daniel Errico, Soaring Ship, LLC.

Warren was just a regular wolf pup... until he discovered that the full moon brings on a transformation unlike any other. Instead of a wild wolf, Warren becomes a polite young boy. For Warren, you see, is the dreaded Wereboy!WEREBOYby Daniel ErricoThe wolves in the woods, grow as wild as trees.They do not say Thank You. They do not say Please. They roll in the dirt and they chomp and they growl.At nighttime they look at the moon and they howl.But Warren was different, the youngest wolf pup.He would not go howl. He would not look up. Instead he ran back to his cave to go hide. And you would not believe what would happen inside.The brightest full moon would cause Warren to change.From a furry young wolf, to a creature most strange. His hair would grow short, and run right to his head.His paws would spread out, and form fingers instead.His snout would shrink down to a small little nub.While his ears became small, like a one-day-old cub.   His teeth would unsharpen, like pieces of corn.And always, somehow, there were clothes to be worn.He’d stand on two legs, and start walking around.And on his behind, not a tail to be found!His parents were shocked when they saw him transform.It certainly, wolfenly, wasn’t the norm.Warren became a polite, quiet, joy.For Warren, you see, was a dreaded… Wereboy!He’d only eat sandwiches, without the crust.He’d didn’t talk back. He preferred earning trust. They scratched at their heads when he cleaned up the cave.It wasn’t how wolves had been taught to behave.His bedtime, he found, was just one tad too late.So he marched off the sleep, without any debate. Instead of the floor, he would sleep on a bed. Leaves for a blanket and straw for his head. By morning he’d be a young wolf pup again.They all kept the secret together. But then…A pack celebration to honor Sinclair,The eldest of wolves, with the whitest of hair. When it came time to howl they all looked around.But the family of Warren was not to be found.They came to the cave, and asked why they had hid.And that’s when they saw him. A… well… a kid.“A Wereboy!” they shouted, “What do we do??”“Don’t get too close or then you’ll catch it too!”Warren sat patiently, reading his books,But somehow, that made them give wolfier looks. His parents objected, “There’s nothing to fear,Everyone changes. Each one of us here.”“Warren’s the wolf that you all knew before,It’s just that he happens to be that and more!”Sinclair stepped ahead, with his scraggily knees.“Excuse me,” he creaked with a cough and a weeze.“I have just the test, and we’ll know the truth soon.All wolves, be they true, howl up at the moon.”So the pack gathered round and they brought him outside.And Warren did something he hadn’t yet tried. He lifted his head and he puffed out his chest,Looked straight at the moon and he gave it his best.And from inside his heart, where it lay all along, Came not a howl, but a beautiful song. Soon one by one, all the wolves sat to listen.Until morning dew on the grass came to glisten. His parents, Sinclair, and the wolves from his pack,Watched the sun change him from Wereboy to back.And they saw him, this time, as they had not before.A wolf, and a boy, and forever, much more. WEREBOYby Daniel ErricoThe wolves in the woods, grow as wild as trees.They do not say Thank You.

Each one of us here.”“Warren’s the wolf that you all knew before,It’s just that he happens to be that and more!”Sinclair stepped ahead, with his scraggily knees.“Excuse me,” he creaked with a cough and a weeze.“I have just the test, and we’ll know the truth soon.All wolves, be they true, howl up at the moon.”So the pack gathered round and they brought him outside.And Warren did something he hadn’t yet tried. He lifted his head and he puffed out his chest,Looked straight at the moon and he gave it his best.And from inside his heart, where it lay all along, Came not a howl, but a beautiful song. Soon one by one, all the wolves sat to listen.Until morning dew on the grass came to glisten. His parents, Sinclair, and the wolves from his pack,Watched the sun change him from Wereboy to back.And they saw him, this time, as they had not before.A wolf, and a boy, and forever, much more. But Warren was different, the youngest wolf pup.He would not go howl. He would not look up. Instead he ran back to his cave to go hide. And you would not believe what would happen inside.The brightest full moon would cause Warren to change.From a furry young wolf, to a creature most strange. His hair would grow short, and run right to his head.His paws would spread out, and form fingers instead.His snout would shrink down to a small little nub.While his ears became small, like a one-day-old cub.   His teeth would unsharpen, like pieces of corn.And always, somehow, there were clothes to be worn.He’d stand on two legs, and start walking around.And on his behind, not a tail to be found!His parents were shocked when they saw him transform.It certainly, wolfenly, wasn’t the norm.Warren became a polite, quiet, joy.For Warren, you see, was a dreaded… Wereboy!He’d only eat sandwiches, without the crust.He’d didn’t talk back. He preferred earning trust. They scratched at their heads when he cleaned up the cave.It wasn’t how wolves had been taught to behave.His bedtime, he found, was just one tad too late.So he marched off the sleep, without any debate. Instead of the floor, he would sleep on a bed. Leaves for a blanket and straw for his head. By morning he’d be a young wolf pup again.They all kept the secret together. But then…A pack celebration to honor Sinclair,The eldest of wolves, with the whitest of hair. When it came time to howl they all looked around.But the family of Warren was not to be found.They came to the cave, and asked why they had hid.And that’s when they saw him.

A… well… a kid.“A Wereboy!” they shouted, “What do we do??”“Don’t get too close or then you’ll catch it too!”Warren sat patiently, reading his books,But somehow, that made them give wolfier looks. His parents objected, “There’s nothing to fear,Everyone changes. Each one of us here.”“Warren’s the wolf that you all knew before,It’s just that he happens to be that and more!”Sinclair stepped ahead, with his scraggily knees.“Excuse me,” he creaked with a cough and a weeze.“I have just the test, and we’ll know the truth soon.All wolves, be they true, howl up at the moon.”So the pack gathered round and they brought him outside.And Warren did something he hadn’t yet tried. He lifted his head and he puffed out his chest,Looked straight at the moon and he gave it his best.And from inside his heart, where it lay all along, Came not a howl, but a beautiful song. Soon one by one, all the wolves sat to listen.Until morning dew on the grass came to glisten. His parents, Sinclair, and the wolves from his pack,Watched the sun change him from Wereboy to back.And they saw him, this time, as they had not before.A wolf, and a boy, and forever, much more. His snout would shrink down to a small little nub.While his ears became small, like a one-day-old cub.   His teeth would unsharpen, like pieces of corn.And always, somehow, there were clothes to be worn.He’d stand on two legs, and start walking around.And on his behind, not a tail to be found!His parents were shocked when they saw him transform.It certainly, wolfenly, wasn’t the norm.Warren became a polite, quiet, joy.For Warren, you see, was a dreaded… Wereboy!He’d only eat sandwiches, without the crust.He’d didn’t talk back. He preferred earning trust. They scratched at their heads when he cleaned up the cave.It wasn’t how wolves had been taught to behave.His bedtime, he found, was just one tad too late.So he marched off the sleep, without any debate. Instead of the floor, he would sleep on a bed. Leaves for a blanket and straw for his head. By morning he’d be a young wolf pup again.They all kept the secret together.

Each one of us here.”“Warren’s the wolf that you all knew before,It’s just that he happens to be that and more!”Sinclair stepped ahead, with his scraggily knees.“Excuse me,” he creaked with a cough and a weeze.“I have just the test, and we’ll know the truth soon.All wolves, be they true, howl up at the moon.”So the pack gathered round and they brought him outside.And Warren did something he hadn’t yet tried. He lifted his head and he puffed out his chest,Looked straight at the moon and he gave it his best.And from inside his heart, where it lay all along, Came not a howl, but a beautiful song. Soon one by one, all the wolves sat to listen.Until morning dew on the grass came to glisten. His parents, Sinclair, and the wolves from his pack,Watched the sun change him from Wereboy to back.And they saw him, this time, as they had not before.A wolf, and a boy, and forever, much more. For Warren, you see, was a dreaded… Wereboy!He’d only eat sandwiches, without the crust.He’d didn’t talk back. He preferred earning trust. They scratched at their heads when he cleaned up the cave.It wasn’t how wolves had been taught to behave.His bedtime, he found, was just one tad too late.So he marched off the sleep, without any debate. Instead of the floor, he would sleep on a bed. Leaves for a blanket and straw for his head. By morning he’d be a young wolf pup again.They all kept the secret together.

never shone.The peasants were angry and started to groan. Finally, Michael could take it no more.He would go fix things and settle this score! So rarely did Kings travel solo by horse,But Michael charged on, and he stayed on his course. The council had urged him that east would be best,But the King disagreed, and rode off to the west. The road was not safe, filled with perilous foes,Like armies of warthogs and red forest trolls. He battled these creatures without any fear,In brave, kingly ways that are not mentioned here. One evening the King paused to look at his map,And somehow, instead, he slipped into a nap. He slept rather soundly on leaf-covered ground,And awoke from his dream when he heard a loud sound. When he looked round a tree, Michael spotted the source.“A cabin!” he whispered, and tied up his horse. Up to the window, he creeped and he crept.When he saw the old wizard, he cheered and he lept! “I found you!” he shouted, and burst through the door.(Though a king should know better than manners so poor). He insisted the wizard reverse what he’d done,Then he took back his wish and demanded the sun. “I’d rather eat wormtoads than do what you say,But I offer you this, a small game we can play. Inside of this box lies the magic you seek.”Sonto grinned wide and continued to speak. “Three keys for three locks, are the only way in.Answer three riddles, unlock them and win.But if you should fail, or not answer in time,Your title is forfeit, your kingdom is mine!” A king must be wise to rule over a nation,So, Michael was ready, without hesitation. They both took a seat, and the duck gave a glare.(The King, without knowing, had taken his chair). The box was between them, it sat in the middle.Sonto spoke first, to recite the first riddle. “I climb up a hill and reach out to the sky,And still you are taller- I ask, who am I?” “An ant,” said the king, as the old wizard frowned“Whose hill only sits but an inch off the ground.”  “Sonto the Bad” muttered, “Well…lucky guess.We’ll see how you handle the riddle up next.” “There’s nothing as large, not on land or at sea,But you won’t feel my weight, when you rest under me” The King answered back with the promptest reply,“Enormous and weightless, you must be the sky.” Sonto was mad, he did not like to lose.For last of his riddles, he knew which to choose.Weeks became months, and the sun never

soundly on leaf-covered ground,And awoke from his dream when he heard a loud sound. When he looked round a tree, Michael spotted the source.“A cabin!” he whispered, and tied up his horse. Up to the window, he creeped and he crept.When he saw the old wizard, he cheered and he lept! “I found you!” he shouted, and burst through the door.(Though a king should know better than manners so poor). He insisted the wizard reverse what he’d done,Then he took back his wish and demanded the sun. “I’d rather eat wormtoads than do what you say,But I offer you this, a small game we can play. Inside of this box lies the magic you seek.”Sonto grinned wide and continued to speak. “Three keys for three locks, are the only way in.Answer three riddles, unlock them and win.But if you should fail, or not answer in time,Your title is forfeit, your kingdom is mine!” A king must be wise to rule over a nation,So, Michael was ready, without hesitation. They both took a seat, and the duck gave a glare.(The King, without knowing, had taken his chair). The box was between them, it sat in the middle.Sonto spoke first, to recite the first riddle. “I climb up a hill and reach out to the sky,And still you are taller- I ask, who am I?” “An ant,” said the king, as the old wizard frowned“Whose hill only sits but an inch off the ground.”  “Sonto the Bad” muttered, “Well…lucky guess.We’ll see how you handle the riddle up next.” “There’s nothing as large, not on land or at sea,But you won’t feel my weight, when you rest under me” The King answered back with the promptest reply,“Enormous and weightless, you must be the sky.” Sonto was mad, he did not like to lose.For last of his riddles, he knew which to choose.The road was not safe, filled with perilous foes,Like armies of warthogs and red forest

but an inch off the ground.”  “Sonto the Bad” muttered, “Well…lucky guess.We’ll see how you handle the riddle up next.” “There’s nothing as large, not on land or at sea,But you won’t feel my weight, when you rest under me” The King answered back with the promptest reply,“Enormous and weightless, you must be the sky.” Sonto was mad, he did not like to lose.For last of his riddles, he knew which to

"I want a monkey who scratches his head! He'd swing from the lights and he'd jump on the bed!" Everyone has wanted a pet at one point or another, but what happens when regular pets won't do? Wally dreams about rambunctious monkeys, noisy otters, and playful giraffes, but will he ever find the perfect pet?by Daniel ErricoWally was sure that he wanted a pet.He talked to his Dad about which pet to get.“I want a Monkey who scratches his head!He’d swing in the house and he’d jump on the bed.”“Well,” said his Dad in a kind sort of way, “Did you know that monkeys eat bugs everyday?”“Oh No,” Wally said, “We have none to eat.”Mom likes to squash all the bugs with her feet.”“Then I want a Hippo!” he screamed to his Dad.“He’d eat all our trash, and Mom would be glad!”“Hippos need water, it helps them stay cool.I guess we can build him a giant sized pool.”“No,” Wally said, “he’d be too big to dry,We’d need a mountain of towels to try.”“I want an Otter who triple back flips,I’d practice swimming when we go for dips.”“Did you know most otters can whistle and chirp?They growl and snort, and perhaps even burp?”“Oh,” Wally said with a sad looking frown,“We’d have to tell him to keep the noise down.”“Let’s get a Giraffe!” Wally said with a smile.“I’d slide from his neck to a giant clothes pile!”“Giraffes hold the record for tallest of all.”“The jump from their head is a twenty foot fall!”“Gosh,” Wally said as he looked at the ceiling,He’d bump his head even if he were kneeling.”“Well how ‘bout a bunny?” he said to his Dad,“A fluffy and floppy one can’t be that bad.”“Bunnies like eating and chew all your stuff. Raising a bunny can really be tough.”“Wow,” Wally answered, “Is that really true?Picking a pet is not easy to do.”“I want a fish!” Wally said, “Let’s get one!”“I think a Goldfish could be lots of fun.”“Hmm,” said his Dad, with a look of delight.“Good idea Wally; I think that you’re right!”“They’re really good swimmers and make funny faces.            And if we get two, we could watch them have races!”“Okay,” said his Dad, “That’s just what we’ll do.One goldfish for me, one goldfish for you!”Wally was sure that he wanted a pet.He talked to his Dad about which pet to get.“I want a Monkey who scratches his head!He’d swing in the house and he’d jump on the bed.”“Well,” said his Dad in a kind sort of way, “Did you know that monkeys eat bugs everyday?”“Oh No,” Wally said, “We have none to eat.”Mom likes to squash all the bugs with her feet.”“Then I want a Hippo!” he screamed to his Dad.“He’d eat all our trash, and Mom would be glad!”“Hippos need water, it helps them stay cool.I guess we can build him a giant sized pool.”“No,” Wally said, “he’d be too big to dry,We’d need a mountain of towels to try.”“I want an Otter who triple back flips,I’d practice swimming when we go for dips.”“Did you know most otters can whistle and chirp?They growl and snort, and perhaps even burp?”“Oh,” Wally said with a sad looking frown,“We’d have to tell him to keep the noise down.”“Let’s get a Giraffe!” Wally said with a smile.“I’d slide from his neck to a giant clothes pile!”“Giraffes hold the record for tallest of all.”“The jump from their head is a twenty foot fall!”“Gosh,” Wally said as he looked at the ceiling,He’d bump his head even if he were kneeling.”“Well how ‘bout a bunny?” he said to his Dad,“A fluffy and floppy one can’t be that bad.”“Bunnies like eating and chew all your stuff. Raising a bunny can really be tough.”“Wow,” Wally answered, “Is that really true?Picking a pet is not easy to do.”“I want a fish!” Wally said, “Let’s get one!”“I think a Goldfish could be lots of fun.”“Hmm,” said his Dad, with a look of delight.“Good idea Wally;

There is so much out there to explore, from polar bears in the arctic to lemurs in the jungle!

by Daniel ErricoI woke in the night to a noise from the kitchen,So off I set out on a fact-finding mission.Whatever it was, I did not have a clue.As I got closer I heard a loud chew.The fridge door was open with food on the ground.A tiny blue penguin was looking around!He looked through our food and he tossed it aside.He opened each can and shook out the inside.“Excuse me!” I said, but he seemed not to care.I shut the fridge door and he shot me a glare.“Jelly,” he said as he held up some bread,With smooth peanut butter, he must have just spread.I woke in the night to a noise from the

bite.But, it wasn’t the oddest thing I saw that night.I heard water splashing the bathroom upstairs,And found a large octopus bathing in there.She had my green shower cap on, just my luck.I saw she

A bright shooting star!I wished for the penguin to get all his jelly.I wished the giraffe would stop using my telly.I wished that the octopus there in my tub,Would exit the bathroom and give it a scrub.I wished that my room would somehow become clean.I wished that this nonsense would all be a dream.The lemurs both left. The giraffe had enough.The octopus gave me back all of my stuff.The blue penguin waddled right up to my feet.He carried a sandwich, most ready to eat.Then he flew off when he flapped both his wingsAnd that, of it all, was the oddest of things...Outside I looked up, and I know it’s bizarre,But guess what flew by me?
