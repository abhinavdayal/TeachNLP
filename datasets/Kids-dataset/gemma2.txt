The Arctic Hill was once an Arctic Mountain. But one day a large purple plink got distracted and barreled into it, taking the top right off. Now it is an icy hill, that can be used as a slippery sea-slide.if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0')};The Noble Gnarble's Diary: Sliding Down the Arctic HillMy best friend Gnara and I headed down to the Arctic Hill.  It was covered in ice, which made it very fun to slide down, and it was a perfect ocean day for it.Gnara slid down and did a trick with her tail.

Fish come from all over the sea to try the Mondobondo burger at the Slimy Dundledun Cafe. You may have heard of Chef Dundledan, who was just voted "The Best Chef Under the Sea".The Noble Gnarble's Diary: Don't Let the Seabugs Bite!The Slimy Dundledun cafe has the best food in the whole ocean. The cook, Chef Dundledan, makes my favorite meal in whole world: the Mondobondo Burger.One day I visited the cafe to order a Mondobondo Burger (or two) and I saw that it was closed. "What happened?" I asked Chef Dundledan. He said, "We've been overrun by seabugs, and we can't open up until they're gone.""Seabugs!" I said, "those little critters are always digging up my plants and eating them."I remembered that seabugs only eat my plants at night, since they sleep during the day. So I came up with a plan. I tip-tailed inside the cafe and started placing plants from my garden on the ground. I made a trail of plants all the way to the Salty Bubble Holes. As the seabugs woke up they ate my plants and followed the trail. When they reached the holes, the bubbles shot them up high into the ocean and they floated away. I lost a few plants but it worth it to eat my delicious Mondoburger!The Slimy Dundledun cafe has the best food in the whole ocean.

The Coral Jungle Gym is always filled with young fish. It popped up one morning a long time ago, and nobody knows who built it. But, the whole ocean is thankful for who it is. It is made of a special coral, that is soft and safe.The Noble Gnarble's Diary: The Water FightOn a beautiful day, I went to the Coral Jungle Gym to play. It was at the center of my favorite park. It had big fake fishing hooks to swing on,  swimming tubes, and even an obstacle course made out of coral. It was very crowded with other gnarbles.  I decided that it was the perfect time for a great big water fight!  We divided up into two teams and went to opposite sides of the park. If you spit water and hit another fish, they were out. The last fish standing would win!When we started, I swam behind a big tire, so that I didn't get hit. I jumped on a swing and swung over lots of the other fish. After a while, more and more fish were out, until it was only me and one other gnarble. It was my best friend Gnara! She swam inside the swimming tubes and I followed after. They zigged and zagged and went this way and that. Just as I swam out the other end, I got hit with water! Gnara had waited for me to come out, and she had won the water fight. I was happy for her, but next time I would be ready!On a beautiful day, I went to the Coral Jungle Gym to play.

The Gishy-Gosh Courts take up a large part of the ocean floor. There are two goals on both sides and gishy-gosh all over. When you smack a gishy-gosh through a goal you get a point (but don't worry, no gishy-gosh are harmed in the playing of this game).if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0')};The Noble Gnarble's Diary: Noble's GameMy best friend Gnara and I went to the Gishy-Gosh courts to play a game. Gishy-Gosh is very fun to play. You win the game by hitting a gishy-gosh with your tail and sending it into the goal. Whoever scores the most goals wins! The only problem is that the Gishy-Gosh can sometimes be sticky, and if they stick to your tail they take a long time to get off. At the courts, two other gnarbles came by and asked Gnara and I to play against them. Gnara was very good at Gishy-Gosh and I had never beaten her, so I was glad we would be playing on the same team. She scored five goals right away! But pretty soon our teams were tied. The other gnarbles would yell at each other when they did something wrong. I went to whack a Gishy-Gosh with my tail but it stuck right to it!"Oh no!" I thought, "The game's almost over and we'll never win now." But then I had an idea. I started touching all the Gishy-Gosh with my tail until I had six of them stuck to me. As time ran out I swam as hard as I could even though it was hard to move with all those Gishy-Gosh stuck to me.  I swam right through the goal, and scored six points at once! As Gnara and I celebrated, she said had never seen a player do that before, but she was glad that I had. My best friend Gnara and I went to the Gishy-Gosh courts to play a game. Gishy-Gosh is very fun to play.

The Sea Library is the oldest building in the ocean. It has more books inside than any library in the world.

The Salty Bubble Holes were formed the last time the Underwater Volcano erupted. The fish like to sit on top of the holes and let the bubbles shoot them high into the water. They say that there are more than 100 holes, all filled with salty bubbles. The Noble Gnarble's Diary: Double BubbleThe salty bubble holes are at the very bottom of the ocean. Huge bubbles shoot out from little tubes on the sand. If you stand right over them, the bubble will shoot you up too, and take you for a fun ride!One day, I was swimming by when I saw a blyfish sitting next to the holes, looking sad."What's wrong?" I asked."Everyone has so much fun riding the bubbles, but I'm too big. They always pop when I stand on top of them," said the blyfish."Hmmmm," I said, "maybe I can help!"I pushed the tubes until they pointed towards each other. When the bubbles came out they started joining together and forming big superbubbles! The blyfish knew just what to do. When he swam over the tubes this time, a superbubble shot out and gave him a fast and fun bubble ride!"Thank You!" he yelled as he shot out of sight.The salty bubble holes are at the very bottom of the ocean.

When he swam over the tubes this time, a superbubble shot out and gave him a fast and fun bubble ride!"Thank You!" he yelled as he shot out of sight."Everyone has so much fun riding the bubbles, but I'm too big.

The Seaweed Forest is one of the scariest places in the ocean. It grows larger every year, and not many fish have been brave enough to go inside. Some fish say that they hear noises from inside when they swim by, but they rarely stick around long enough to tell what it is. The Noble Gnarble's Diary: Who Could It Be Now?I usually never go to the Seaweed Forest because they say that it's haunted. One day I decided to go inside and see what was in there.It was dark, and the seaweed was very thick.  There were new and fun things that I had never seen before, too! There were new kinds of fish, and plants that glowed. I saw a stream of colorful water and followed it until I came up to a cabin. It was made of old twigs and seashells. "Who could live in there?" I thought.  There was steam coming from the chimney, so I went in to get a closer look. Someone was sitting in a chair but I couldn't see who they were. I thought about knocking on the door but it had a pirate symbol on it, and I decided it was best not to bother them.I left the seaweed forest and got back home before anyone noticed how long I'd been gone.I usually never go to the Seaweed Forest because they say that it's haunted.

The SeaCottage Theater puts on a new play every week. They tell all sorts of tales, from romance, to comedy, to adventure and pirates. The best part is that everyone is allowed to try out to act in the SeaCottage plays, and almost everyone gets a part when they do. if(typeof __ez_fad_position!='undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-freechildrenstories_com-banner-1-0')};The Noble Gnarble's Diary: Give My Regards to Orangebeard  I decided to head to the Sea Cottage Theater to catch a show because they always put on the best plays!The play they were performing was called "Orangebeard's Adventures"!A water gnome played Orangebeard and he wore orange seaweed on his face to look like a beard.  The actors pretended that they were pirates, sailing across the ocean looking for treasure. They encountered huge waves and sea monsters and even sunburn! At the end, Orangebeard found a wonderful treasure and brought it back to his ship. He locked it inside a chest and told the audience that he keeps the key in his favorite place in the world.I wondered where that could be, as I clapped loudly with my fins. I decided to head to the Sea Cottage Theater to catch a show because they always put on the best plays!The play they were performing was called "Orangebeard's Adventures"!A water gnome played Orangebeard and he wore orange seaweed on his face to look like a beard.  The actors pretended that they were pirates, sailing across the ocean looking for treasure. They encountered huge waves and sea monsters and even sunburn! At the end, Orangebeard found a wonderful treasure and brought it back to his ship.
