 Monster Mannersby Daniel ErricoIn terms of monster etiquette,A manners guide is hard to get.I’ve walked the grandest monster hallsAnd rummaged through their monster malls.I’ve learned, in time, their tricks and rules,Those brooding blargs and slimy ghouls.They don’t shake hands, they wiggle tails.They’re far too scared of breaking nails.They cry a lot and blow their noses.Cameras make them strike their poses.Their birthday balls are legendary.Hairy gifts are customary.They don’t eat cake, it’s far too sweet.They much prefer a book to eat.If ever you should have the chance.I must insist you watch one dance.They stomp their feet and La-La-La.And sometimes learn to Cha-Cha-Cha.A monster’s home is hard to find.They’re made of branches, mud, and vine.They’re masterful in snowball fights. They’ll wait to hit you day or night. I promise, you will too, defend,How monster’s make a mighty friend.What you’ve heard might be contrary.Trust me, monsters: they’re not scary.
