Don’t Judge a BookMore than just a story, each picture is revealed to be part of a larger picture. Take a guess what you're really seeing, and then read on to find the answer! Don't Judge a Book is a rhyming, visual logic game.Don’t Judge a Bookby Daniel ErricoYou can’t be too sure of that which your eyes seeNot always are things what you think them to beIs that music you see from a set of headphones?Or carolers singing melodious tones…Could this be the sight of a freshly lit match?Or maybe a marshmallow, starting to catch…Watch as we witness a nice ping-pong shot.Or maybe a dishwasher hanging a pot…So next time it seems like you’re in for a fallYou may find the drop is not nearly as tall…Sometimes it seems like you’re caught in a storm.When really you’re in for some extra popcorn…It’s certainly wonderful winning first place.But don’t forget those who are cheering the race…It looks like there’s trouble because his boat sank.But really he’s seeing a shark in its tank…The earth is so large there is nothing as great.That is, except, for the world you create.B & N
