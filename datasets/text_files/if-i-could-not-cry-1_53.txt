If I Could Not Cryby Daniel ErricoIf I Could Not Cryby Daniel ErricoIf I could not cry… I would be a snowy tree in the middle of winter.If I could not cry… I would be a river, needing to flow.If I could not cry… I would be the moon, smiling so big that the would cannot see.If I could not cry… I would be a bird in a cage, wanting to fly.If I could not cry… I would be a garden, waiting for water.If I could not cry… I would be a volcano, angry and ready to explode.If I could not cry… I would be the wind against a barn, not able to push past.If I could not cry… I would be an underground crystal, secret and hidden.But I am not a tree,or a river,or the moon,or a bird,or a garden,or a volcano,or the wind,or a crystal.I am me.
